Learn about our editorial policies Published April 21, 2025 06:39 PM EDT Source: TradingView.com. Close Key Takeaways Tesla shares skidded on Monday as investors await the EV maker’s highly anticipated quarterly results, due after Tuesday’s closing bell. Since finding a local bottom in early March, Tesla shares have consolidated within a descending triangle, a bearish chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s recent downtrend. Investors should watch important support levels on Tesla's chart around $170 and $139, while also tracking overhead areas near $289 and $360. Tesla ( TSLA ) shares skidded on Monday as investors await the EV maker’s highly anticipated quarterly results , due after Tuesday’s closing bell. The company released weaker-than-expected first-quarter delivery numbers earlier this month, and analysts have expressed concern about the impact that the Trump administration’s tariffs will have on the auto maker the remainder of the year. Market watchers will be looking for updates from CEO Elon Musk about how Washington’s trade war with China stands to affect Tesla. Tesla shares have reversed gear in 2025, slumping 44% since the start of the year amid concerns that Musk’s active involvement in the Trump administration has dented the automaker’s brand, hurting sales, and distracted him from leading the company . The stock fell nearly 6% to $227.50 on Monday. Below, we break down the technicals on Tesla’s chart and identify important levels worth watching. Descending Triangle Takes Shape Since finding a local bottom in early March, Tesla shares have consolidated within a descending triangle , a bearish chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s recent downtrend. Moreover, the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed below the 200-day MA last week to form an ominous death cross , a technical event that forecasts lower prices. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) points to lackluster price momentum , with the stock’s recent upswing barely bumping the indicator back above the 50 threshold. Let’s identify two key support levels on Tesla’s chart where the shares could attract buying interest amid further selling and also locate important overhead areas worth tracking during potential recovery efforts. Key Support Levels to Watch A breakdown below the descending channel’s lower trendline could see selling accelerate toward $170. Investors may look to place buy limit orders in this location near the lower range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart throughout May and June last year. A more significant drop opens the door for a move down to $139, a location on the chart that could attract strong support near last year’s prominent April swing low . This area also sits just below a projected bars pattern downside target that takes the stock’s downtrend following an earlier descending triangle on the chart and repositions it from the current pattern’s top trendline, with the analysis assuming a downward continuation move may play out. Important Overhead Areas Worth Tracking Amid potential recovery efforts in the stock, investors should keep a close eye on the $289 level. This region on the chart could provide considerable selling pressure near the 200-day MA, last month’s swing high , and the stock’s post-election breakaway gap closing price. Further buying in Tesla shares could drive a move up to $360. Investors who have bought the stock at lower levels may look for exit points in this location near a trendline that connects February’s countertrend high with a range of corresponding trading activity stretching back to last November.

      "title": "Is Tesla (TSLA) the Most Promising Long-Term Stock According to Analysts?",
      "content": "Is Tesla (TSLA) the Most Promising Long-Term Stock According to Analysts? Maham Fatima April 21, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of the 11 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other promising long-term stocks. On March 31, Banrion’s Shana Sissel recently appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to discuss that buying at lower valuations is favorable for long-term investors. Shana Sissel highlighted that the markets now want transparency, given the persistent volatility that has lasted for a while now. When this clarity is lacking, it becomes difficult for investors and businesses to plan for the long term. This uncertainty has led to soft consumer and CEO confidence, which makes it challenging to develop long-term strategies when key aspects such as industrial policy, business policy, and taxes remain unresolved in the US. Sissel emphasized that until there is more certainty, volatility is likely to persist. She expressed skepticism that any immediate announcements would provide the level of information investors desire, especially because of the administration’s habit of making statements that are later contradicted or revised. However, Sissel pointed out that long-term investors can find attractive buying opportunities if they look beyond the current uncertainty. She noted that the recent drop in valuations for many tech stocks now presents favorable buying opportunities for long-term investors. Regardless of the short-term fluctuations in policy uncertainty, many tech and security companies still benefit from long-term demand due to trends like the ongoing adoption of AI and the growing need for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection. Even when government decisions are unclear, these sectors are resilient because their products and services address fundamental needs that are unlikely to change with fluctuating market cycles. Our Methodology We first sifted through the Finviz stock screener and financial media reports to compile a list of the top stocks with high upside potential of over 40%. We then selected 11 stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 20%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Note: All data was sourced on April 21. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Story Continues Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) the Most Promising Long-Term Stock According to Analysts? Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 40.76% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Average Upside Potential as of April 21: 42.93% Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and energy generation & storage systems through its two segments. The Automotive segment offers EVs, automotive regulatory credits, and vehicle insurance services. The Energy Generation and Storage segment engages with solar energy generation and energy storage products. The company achieved record deliveries in Q4 2024, with Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle of any kind in 2024. Tesla also made investments in manufacturing, AI, and robotics during the year. Its autonomous driving and AI-related initiatives are expected to make up 90% of its valuation shortly. Optimus alone can generate more than $10 trillion in revenue for Tesla. While Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is somewhat insulated from the current tariff environment as compared to other major automakers in the US, the company still faces some macro challenges. On April 16, Piper Sandler reiterated the stock as Overweight and cut its estimates on the stock’s price from $450 to $400. Tesla’s first-quarter financials are expected to be disappointing, with deliveries falling short of expectations.  This is because Tesla heavily relies on international sources, mainly China, for a significant amount of its parts and batteries. JDP Capital Management initiated the stock in June 2024 and stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is new core position that I wrote about in 2024 Half Year Letter. The stock was up 115% in 2024. We benefited from the June 2024 timing of our purchase, buying after the stock had declined about 30% in the first part of the year. Overall, TSLA ranks 11th on our list of the 11 most promising long-term stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the growth potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

      "content": "Tesla settles wrongful death lawsuit claiming sudden acceleration in Ohio crash Mike Scarcella April 21, 2025 1 min read In this article: TSLA By Mike Scarcella (Reuters) -Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla has agreed to settle a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the estate of a man who was killed in 2021 after his Tesla crashed and caught fire near Dayton, Ohio. Tesla and lawyers for the estate disclosed the settlement in a filing on Monday in federal court in San Francisco but did not reveal its terms. The carmaker and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Todd Walburg, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment. Tesla has denied any wrongdoing in the case, blaming the driver for the fatal crash. A jury trial had been scheduled for April 2026. The estate's lawsuit said Clyde Leach’s Tesla Model Y suddenly accelerated, went off the road and slammed into a pillar at an Ohio gas station. Leach, 72, died from blunt force trauma, burns and other injuries. “Tesla was aware that its vehicles — including the Model Y — have reportedly on hundreds of occasions accelerated suddenly and without explanation,” the lawsuit said. Tesla had asserted that Leach’s model “was state-of-the-art and was not defective in design or manufacture.” Last year, Tesla settled a lawsuit over a 2018 car crash that killed an Apple engineer after his Model X, operating on Autopilot, swerved off a highway near San Francisco. That settlement was made on the eve of trial. Other lawsuits against Tesla are pending. In February, lawyers for the company convinced a Florida appeals court to limit the damages it could be forced to pay in a wrongful death lawsuit accusing it of misstating the capabilities of the Autopilot system.

      "content": "Tesla stock rises after Musk says time at DOGE will drop 'significantly' Tesla is navigating CEO Elon Musk's dwindling popularity, new EV competition, and the threat of auto tariffs. Pras Subramanian · Senior Reporter April 23, 2025 4 min read In this article: ^IXIC ^GSPC TSLA Tesla ( TSLA ) stock rose 3% in early trade Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more time at Tesla and less time in Washington, D.C., news that overshadowed a challenging quarter for the company that saw results come in far below Wall Street forecasts. \"Starting early next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] will drop significantly,\" Musk told investors on the company's earnings call. Musk said he'd continue to spend a day or two per week at DOGE, but said he will be \"allocating far more of my time\" to Tesla. \"While we would have preferred a full re-engagement with Tesla (as opposed to still sharing time with political efforts), we nevertheless believe the narrative should benefit from a re-engaged Elon on Tesla – simply, with Tesla more heavily focused on AV/AI, Elon is more important than ever to keep this narrative moving forward ... Elon is Tesla,\" Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients after the earnings call. Tesla reported first quarter revenue of $19.34 billion, below the $21.43 billion Wall Street was forecasting and the $21.3 billion reported a year ago, according to Bloomberg estimates. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, missing the $0.44 forecast by analysts. Adjusted profits in the quarter fell 40% from a year ago. Read more about Tesla's stock moves and Wednesday's market action. Tesla said plans for new affordable vehicles are on track for start of production in the first half of 2025 and that it still expects Robotaxi volume production starting in 2026. Along with Robotaxi testing, these were two big investor concerns heading into earnings. The company blamed trade uncertainty as a reason behind slumping sales. \"Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,\" the company said in a statement. \"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\" Musk said on the call that he told Trump that \"lower tariffs\" were better for the country but ultimately the decision on tariffs is up to the president. Because of this uncertainty, Tesla said it would revisit its 2025 guidance in its second quarter financial update and removed its long-term growth forecast. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet \"The key [trade] headwinds are: (1) Energy business is disproportionally affected by tariffs as TSLA sources the LFP batteries from China, (2) Volume guidance was temporarily paused due to tariff uncertainty, (3) China restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are employed in permanent magnets for electric motors, may negatively affect Tesla's business; (4) A relevant portion of manufacturing equipment is sourced from China,\" BofA analyst John Murphy noted in a research report. Story Continues Tesla said its first quarter gross margin hit 16.3%, better than the 16.1% expected, with automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits coming in at 12.5%. In the past, Tesla had promised to launch a lower-priced electric vehicle in the first half of 2025, along with other new vehicles that the company said would allow it to return to a 50% growth rate compared to 2023. Reuters reported on Friday that Tesla's plans to launch an affordable EV, which include a stripped-down version of the Model Y, have been delayed until later this year. Tesla has not responded to that report. Tesla execs on the call did not deny the Reuters report, saying only that the company was focusing on affordability and these efforts would resemble some of the existing Tesla models. The big concern for Tesla's bread-and-butter auto business is demand. Earlier this month, Tesla reported first quarter deliveries of 336,681 units making it the worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022. Conversely, rival automakers were seeing huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on April 2. Tesla's main rival overseas, BYD ( BYDDY ), has been eating into Tesla's market share for some time now. And President Trump's auto sector tariffs of 25% on foreign imports have automakers like Tesla in a bind. Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at at March 21 employee town hall. · X.com Demand concerns led to falling sales across a number of key regions for Tesla. Tesla registration data in key European regions fell in March , another sign that sales are continuing to slide as Tesla's brand has also taken a hit due to the right-wing political activities of CEO Elon Musk . Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe have seen Musk's and Tesla's brands suffer. Protests at Tesla showrooms in the US and abroad are growing, as are acts of vandalism on Tesla EVs. Musk added on the call that the company was focused on deploying Robotaxi testing in Austin in June, and claimed that Tesla's vehicles were significantly cheaper than Waymo's EVs, which he said contained expensive sensor suites.

      "content": "Stock market today: Dow drops 950 points, S&P 500, Nasdaq tumble as Trump bashes Fed's Powell again Brett LoGiurato and Ines Ferré Updated April 21, 2025 2 min read In this article: ^IXIC NVDA ^DJI BTC-USD ^GSPC US stocks tanked on Monday as President Trump hurled criticism at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell again, sparking concerns of Fed independence at a time when markets have been reacting to the president's whipsawing tariff policy . The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was down more than 2.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) sank 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped almost 2.4%, or nearly 1,000 points. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer notes , the stock market remains largely at the mercy of Trump's tariffs. Different headlines and shifts in narratives have driven big market swings over the past several weeks, with all three indexes down since Trump's \"Liberation Day\" event. Meanwhile, investors are grappling with a growing concern: Trump's bluster around removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell . Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for allegedly keeping interest rates too high, with his latest insult posted on Monday morning, warning that the economy could slow \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\" Trump's new focus on Powell comes after the Fed chief delivered a stark warning about the potential effects of tariffs on the economy. Read more: The latest on Trump's tariffs As these twin storylines hovered over markets, the \"sell America\" trade gathered more steam. The US dollar ( DX=F ) index sank to its lowest level since 2022, and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) rose back above 4.4%. Meanwhile the 30-year (^ TYX ) yield moved up to 4.9%. Earnings season continues, with this week looming as pivotal. Two of the \"Magnificent Seven\" take the spotlight of some 120 S&P 500 companies reporting this week: Elon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) and Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ). Tesla added to a whopping 40%-plus loss so far this year with a near-6% dive on Monday . Another Magnificent Seven peer, Nvidia ( NVDA ), slid as China looks to domestic alternatives amid new US curbs on Nvidia's chip sales. Elsewhere, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to its highest level since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Gold ( GC=F ) also reached another record, crossing the $3,400 level for the first time. LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 28 updates Mon, April 21, 2025 at 8:01 PM UTC Ines Ferré Stocks tumble as Trump escalates criticism against Fed Chair Jerome Powell Stocks tanked on Monday as investors turned their focus to President Trump's renewed call for lower interest rates and contention with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) also sank more than 2.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped more than 900 points while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) fell more than 2.5% as high-growth tech stocks sold off. Tech and Consumer Discretionary stocks declined the most as Tesla ( TSLA ) slid more than 5% and Nvidia ( NVDA ) sank 4%. Stocks took a leg lower on Monday after President Trump hurled another public insult at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, warning of a \"SLOWING\" of the economy \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\" Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) showed signs of decoupling as the world's largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest level since early April, briefly surpassing $88,000, outperforming the Nasdaq year to date. Gold also rose to an all-time high above $3,430 per ounce as the US dollar slid. Mon, April 21, 2025 at 7:30 PM UTC Josh Schafer Big Tech earnings could reveal if stocks are 'washed out' — or if they have more room to fall With more than 100 S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) companies set to report first quarter financial results this week , investors will be closely listening to how individual outlooks are shaping up amid shifting policies from the Trump administration . Technology stocks, which have led the selling action during the tariff-induced market drawdown , will be in particular focus. Each \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is now off 23% or more from its most recent 52-week high. Given that the market has already sold off extensively over the past month , several Wall Street strategists have pointed out that simply watching how stocks react the day after a major earnings release will be a telling sign of whether the market has bottomed. Take Tesla ( TSLA ), for instance. A fair amount of bad news has already likely been priced into Tesla's stock, with disappointing deliveries for the quarter already known and 2025 annual earnings estimates already down about 20% in the past four months. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote in a note to clients on Monday that Tesla's stock reaction after it reports earnings on Tuesday night will \"tell us how 'washed out' key names\" in the stock market have become Read more here.

Futures sank after the US and Iran held \"constructive\" talks over the weekend about Tehran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, the global trade war escalates as Beijing warned countries not to team up against China when striking tariff deals with the US. \"The threats to global crude demand are back front and center on most traders' radar,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial, said on Monday.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian joins Market Domination to break down the details, including expectations for earnings and Musk's influence on the brand. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here . Video Transcript 00:00 Josh Tesla segue today as a big first quarter earnings report now looms tomorrow after the bell. For more on what to expect from the EV giant, let's bring in Yahoo Finances senior automotive reporter, Pras Subramanian. Pras. 00:17 Pras Subramanian Hey, thanks Josh. Yeah, big earnings report on tap as questions swirl around Musk and that cheap Tesla EV. You know, as we all know, it's been a rough quarter for Tesla stock down over 40% year to date. Q1 deliveries were a big miss, concerns about demand, and a lot of that is on CEO Elon Musk. His political activities, like Doge are sort of hurting the brand among people who disagree with his actions. And then there's the effect of him not being around, right, which sort of some, some like Dan Ives are calling a code red situation that needs repair. Now, for the numbers, looking at around 21.43 billion, just slightly higher than a year ago. Street also expecting around adjusted EPS of 44 cents a share, translating to adjusted net income of 1.57 billion. So, that's all great, but the bigger questions are, around Musk and the status of that cheaper EV now, which Reuters now says is delayed till later this year. 01:48 Josh And so when we are listening for to the conference call tomorrow, is that really going to be the focus or should we still be photo focusing on things, Pras, like automotive gross margin that traditionally have also been something that investors zero in on? 02:18 Pras Subramanian Yeah, I know. I'm sure they'll be looking at those metrics to see how the auto business is doing, but from what I hear from the analyst community, what we hear from people, investors is the status of what is Musk doing? Is he going to return? You know, supposed that May deadline for when special employees need to go back to the to back out of the government. That's the big question is what is Musk's status? And then of course, yes, Julia, of course, you know, that cheaper EV many have questions about, when is that going to come out? That's supposed to spur the next leg of demand and and sales for the company, because right now we're seeing those sales sort of lag even with that new model Y that just came out in March. Those haven't actually moved the needle just quite yet. Visualizza commenti Condizioni e Informativa sulla privacy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

      "content": "Tesla Is Sinking Again Today: Is It Time to Buy the Stock? By Keith Noonan – Apr 21, 2025 at 3:02PM Key Points Tesla's latest slump was triggered by news that it is delaying the launch of its lower-cost Model Y. Though Tesla shares have slumped significantly in 2025, the company still has a highly growth-dependent valuation. With soft vehicle deliveries and the delay of its inexpensive new EV, Tesla stock is a risky bet ahead of its Q1 report Tuesday. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.40 %) $ 15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) stock fell again on Monday after news broke of a major delay in its production plans. As of 2 p.m. ET, the company's share price was down 7.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 3.4% as the market responded to intensifying macroeconomic concerns. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.40 %) $ -15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.17 - $ 451.68 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 95M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A The company-specific news that investors were reacting to was that Tesla will delay the U.S. debut of the bare-bones version of its Model Y. That lower-priced new electric vehicle ( EV ) was slated to launch this quarter, but its launch will now be pushed out to at least the third quarter, and possibly all the way into 2026, according to Reuters, which was unable to learn the reason for the delay. Tesla stock is now down by 45% across 2025's trading. Is Tesla stock a buy right now? The electric vehicle (EV) giant is scheduled to publish its first-quarter results after the market closes Tuesday. The Q1 delivery figures it published earlier this month suggest that it will report significant declines in sales and earnings for the period. With the release of the cheaper new mass-market Model Y being postponed, the company's potential sales rebound has likely also been delayed, and the company's overall performance for the year could take a significant hit. Despite its big sell-off, Tesla stock still trades at massively growth-dependent valuations. Given that it's changing hands at more than 88 times this year's expected earnings and approximately 6.7 times expected revenue despite indications that its sales will decline further in the near term, the stock looks risky. With the challenging near-term outlook for its core EV business, shares look expensive at current prices. Unless you're very bullish about the premise that its robotaxi service will emerge as a major revenue and earnings driver within the next couple of years, I think it would be best to hold off on buying Tesla stock right now.

      "content": "Robinhood Data Shows Retail Investors Keep Piling into Tesla (TSLA) Amid ‘Opportune Time’ Fahad Saleem April 21, 2025 4 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of 10 Stocks in Wall Street’s Watchlist . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other stocks in Wall Street’s watchlist. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, in a latest program on CNBC reiterated his concerns about a slowdown in AI spending and said that major technology companies were already facing the impact of a downbeat trend in the industry before the tariff wars started: “When the MAG 7 reported the December quarter or calendar Q4, six of the seven had their March revenue estimates already cut. So think about that for a second. But the thing is, when the Fed’s cutting like it was last year, nobody cares, right? If the stocks are going up, the charts look good. Why worry about fundamentals or valuations?,” Niles said. “Because the stocks are going higher. So looking forward, I expect all the estimates to come down yet again for the June quarter. When these companies report the March quarter, they were already having troubles when they reported the December quarter before all this tariff stuff kicked in.” Niles said that companies were buying more ahead of the China tariffs because they expected that duties were coming from the US. “You can just see that from the China export data already, where for China as a whole, in the month of March, exports were up 12.4%. People were expecting 4.6%. So that’s a massive beat there. And so you can already tell demand’s being pulled forward. So my thought was there was a payback period coming anyway.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Wall Street analysts have been talking about lately. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Robinhood Data Shows Retail Investors Keep Piling into Tesla (TSLA) Amid ‘Opportune Time’ Pixabay/Public Domain Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 99 Steve Quirk, Robinhood chief brokerage officer, recently talked about the latest retail trade data released by his platform for February. Asked about the retail investors’ interest in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) despite the latest declines, Quirk said: “You know, there’s a lot of people that have strong beliefs in Tesla, and that’s it. And you know, they are looking at this as an opportune time to add to portfolios. And you know, they’re a lot like portfolio managers. These, these, they’re quite savvy, our customers. They’re, they rotate out of names where they see nice appreciation, and they rotate into ones where they think there’s an opportunity.” Story Continues Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “The largest relative detractors in the quarter were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) (not owned), Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Broadcom (not owned). We’ve spoken at length about our rationale for not owning Tesla. The stock enjoyed a 54% return during the quarter, with effectively all of the share price performance strength coming in the post-election period, as the market expressed a positive view on Elon Musk’s prominent role in the incoming Trump administration and its potential implications for Tesla. While we agree this development should be a net positive for Tesla and recognize the company’s interesting future prospects for autonomous driving and humanoid robots, its current valuation demands that shareholders pay primarily for potential innovations that have yet to materialize, with uncertain risks and timelines, presenting a different type of risk profile than we are comfortable with. Today, Tesla is an automobile manufacturer limited to the higher-income segment and is increasingly challenged to sell vehicles when interest rates are not zero. As such, we continue to question the company’s long-term growth profile, its ability to scale a large robotaxi service (which seems to be the source of euphoria in Tesla shares), and its corporate governance.” Overall, TSLA ranks 6th on our list of stocks in Wall Street’s watchlist. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

      "content": "Trump's Fed Threat Sends Shockwaves Through Wall Street Khac Phu Nguyen April 21, 2025 2 min read In this article: TSLA Markets opened the week on edge as investors rushed to de-risk amid fresh fears Donald Trump may actually try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The former president doubled down on Truth Social, calling for preemptive rate cuts, while his team admitted it's actively reviewing Powell's future. That was enough to spark a broad selloff in US assets even if firing a Fed Chair isn't exactly straightforward. But perception matters. And right now, global investors are seeing cracks in the foundation of Fed independence and running. The dollar dropped to its lowest level since late 2023, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index down as much as 1% intraday. Hedge funds accelerated the exit, holding their least bullish positions since October, while currencies like the euro and yen punched through key levels. Meanwhile, bond markets flashed recession signals: short-term yields fell sharply as traders piled into two-year notes, while long bonds sold off steepening the curve in a rare nine-week streak. Equities sank more than 2%, with firms like Citigroup, BlackRock, and Bank of America turning bearish on US stocks. Their message? The US exceptionalism trade is fading fast. Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and other high-beta names may feel the heat if rate cut expectations slip or volatility spikes. While markets still price in multiple Fed cuts this year, former NY Fed president Bill Dudley warned the Fed may move slower than expected. And if Powell is weakened or sidelined politically, that could mean fewer tools and more confusion when recession risks hit hard. Bottom line: if investors start to believe the Fed can't act independently, it won't just shake the dollar. It'll shake the entire bull case for US assets. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

      "content": "Why Shares of Tesla Are Falling Ahead of Elon Musk's Big Day By Bram Berkowitz – Apr 21, 2025 at 1:13PM Key Points Tesla will report earnings Tuesday after the market closes. All eyes will be on CEO Elon Musk, who will host a conference call with Wall Street analysts. China's government said Monday that it will take retaliatory actions against countries that work with the U.S. to harm its economy. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.40 %) $ 15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET Shares of electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) were trading about 7% lower as of 1:03 p.m. ET Monday. That sell-off came as tensions between the U.S. and China continued to escalate and as investors looked ahead to Tesla's first-quarter earnings report, which is due out after the market closes Tuesday. Musk will face the music U.S. stocks broadly fell on Monday morning after China's government warned that it will retaliate against any countries that partner with the U.S. on trade in ways that hurt China economically. In addition, market watchers pointed to President Donald Trump's tariff policies and his latest social media tirades against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as drivers of Wall Street's slide. However, when it comes to Tesla specifically, investors are focused on the company's upcoming earnings report. The EV maker has already revealed that its deliveries were weak in the first quarter, but after months of controversial actions by CEO Elon Musk in his public sector role, the Q1 earnings call will provide analysts the opportunity to pose questions to him on topics ranging from Tesla's struggling EV business to its new initiatives. It's also possible they'll ask him about his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Trump's tariffs. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.40 %) $ -15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.17 - $ 451.68 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 95M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, said on Monday that Musk faces a \"code red situation\" if he doesn't start to distance himself from Trump and DOGE. In a recent research note, Ives wrote that Tesla could face \"potentially 15%-20% permanent demand destruction ... due to the brand damage Musk has created with DOGE.\" Questions about the EV business On Tesla, Musk will need to reassure investors about the core EV business, which seems to be losing traction in China and Europe, as well as longer-term catalysts for the company like cheaper models, full self-driving, and robotics, hopes for which seem to be propping up the stock and justifying its nosebleed valuation. Many traders still believe that Tesla will be a generational artificial intelligence company and that it will continue to change the world. Those things could eventually prove to be true, but I prefer to avoid stocks that aren't trading based on their fundamentals, especially when their core businesses appear to be losing steam.

      "title": "Tesla Earnings Call Looms Amid Mounting Pressures: 3 Key Questions",
      "content": "Tesla Earnings Call Looms Amid Mounting Pressures: 3 Key Questions Andrew Rocco April 21, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA GOOG Can Tesla Weather the Storm? Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock Tesla ( TSLA ) is the leading EV-maker worldwide. However, recently, as Tesla attempts to enter new businesses and diversify from its core business, its legacy business has seen growth slow significantly amid political backlash, a slowing EV market, more competition, and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Between the “Top Gear” Roadster review controversy, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla and its eccentric CEO Elon Musk have been through tough times before and made it out to the other side on top. Nevertheless, Musk and Tesla have their backs against the wall once again heading into earnings tomorrow. With Tesla shares already down about 40% year-to-date, investors will be closely watching Tuesday night’s earnings call. That said, be sure to have a stomach for volatility if you want to play earnings, as the options market implies about a 9% move after the earnings are released.  Below are key questions that investors will be looking to get answered Tuesday. 1. Tariffs Impact: What Tesla is Doing to Mitigate? Though Elon Musk has become one of the most outspoken Trump supporters and a de facto member of the administration, he is one of the most negatively impacted by the administration’s ever-evolving tariff policy. While Tesla manufactures many of its vehicles in the United States, it relies heavily on imports and the global supply chain for parts. In addition, raw materials like lithium and cobalt are necessary ingredients for battery production and must be sourced from countries like Canada. 2. DOGE Political Fallout: When Will Musk Return to TSLA? Until recently, electric vehicles were mainly a staple for those on the left side of the political aisle. However, that narrative has been flipped on its head after President Donald Trump tapped Elon Musk to run the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE). Since then, Musk has faced significant backlash from Democrats, including boycotts and vandalism. To make matters worse, most of Musk’s already limited time has been spent on DOGE, not Tesla. The last time Musk took time away from Tesla was when he purchased Twitter. At that time, investors reacted negatively and sold shares. In tomorrow’s earnings call it will be critical that Elon Musk gives an exact return date to Tesla. Should he not, investors are likely to react negatively. 3. Will the Robotaxi Launch on Time? Elon Musk is known for his ambitious and aggressive timelines. While Musk often succeeds in the long term, he is not known for his punctuality. Currently, Tesla plans to roll out its first autonomous “Robotaxi” program in Austin, Texas, this summer. However, many investors are skeptical because Trump’s tariffs impact parts needed for Musk’s Cybercab. In the meantime, Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) Waymo robotaxi service is off to a significant lead in the race for autonomous taxi service. Waymo already operates in four major cities and is expected to roll out five more cities in the near future. Failure of Tesla to confirm its autonomous ride-hailing service timeline will likely put more pressure on the stock. Story Continues Bottom Line As the market braces for Tesla’s earnings report, the confluence of tariff pressures, political headwinds, and uncertainty surrounding the Robotaxi launch create a formidable challenge for the EV giant. While Tesla has demonstrated resilience in the face of past crises, the current multifaceted storm presents a unique test of its ability to navigate a complex and evolving landscape.

Analysts pointed to uncertainty around the long-promised robotaxi reveal in Austin and mounting questions about CEO Elon Musk's time split between Tesla and other ventures, including his work on the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives flagged a code red scenario if Musk signals extended involvement with DOGE, citing reputational risks. Separately, Reuters reported delays to Tesla's planned launch of a more affordable, U.S.-built version of the Model Y, which is now pushed back by several months. Barclays cut its price target on Tesla to $275 from $310, maintaining an \"Equal Weight\" rating. The firm pointed to softening fundamentals but said investor focus could shift if the company delivers a strong narrative during its earnings call. Analyst expectations for Tesla's 2025 deliveries have already dropped to 1.65 million, down from over 2 million. The company also risks missing internal targets for a second straight year. Investors will be watching for updates on the timing of its low-cost EV and rollout of its Full Self-Driving system. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

The S&P 500 (SPY) more than 2.2% at 10.57am, the dollar plunged to a 15-month low, and 10-year Treasury yields dropped to around 4.4%all signs investors are growing nervous about the Fed's independence. Gold surged past $3,400 an ounce as money fled to safety, while the Swiss franc and Japanese yen both rallied. The worry? That Trump might try to remove Powell, shaking the foundation of U.S. monetary credibility. Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) sank 6.8% at 10.57am today ahead of earnings, with Wedbush's Dan Ives calling this a code red moment for Elon Musk. Ives urged Musk to pivot his attention away from government advisory roles and back to the core business as pressure mounts. Meanwhile, credit markets flashed warning signs: the cost to insure investment-grade debt jumped, and two companies canceled bond sales due to poor conditions. American Express was the only issuer that moved forwardbarely. Behind the scenes, capital is already rotating out of U.S. assets. Deutsche Bank noted Chinese clients are cutting exposure to Treasuries in favor of European debt, Japanese bonds, and gold. Even though legal experts say firing Powell isn't straightforward, just floating the idea rattles global confidence. Strategists warn this could open the door to accelerated de-dollarization. As one put it, markets could see the most dramatic rush to the exit from U.S. assets imaginable if Fed credibility cracks. That's no longer a tail riskit's creeping into base-case territory.

Technology stocks, which have led the selling action during the tariff-induced market drawdown , will be in particular focus. Each of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are now off 23% or more from their most recent 52-week high. Given that the market has already sold off extensively over the past month , several Wall Street strategists have pointed out that simply watching how stocks react the day after a major earnings release will be a telling sign of whether the market has bottomed. \"Ultimately, the importance of the Q1 reporting period will be in the information it provides as to what is priced into single stocks as C-suites start providing some tariff context,\" Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients ahead of the earnings rush. Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) are set to report this week. Shares of the search giant are down nearly 29% from their recent 52-week high. Tesla stock is down about 54% from its recent 52-week high. A fair amount of bad news has already likely been priced into Tesla's stock, with disappointing deliveries for the quarter already known and 2025 annual earnings estimates already down about 20% in the past four months. But the question remains whether the stock has been rerated low enough ahead of its earnings release Tuesday . Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote in a note to clients on Monday that Tesla's stock reaction after it reports earnings on Tuesday night will \"tell us how 'washed out' key names\" in the stock market have become. Truist Co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance that the stock market sell-off of the past month has occurred in anticipation of a weakening earnings outlook for corporations as Trump's tariffs take hold. This, Lerner said, makes the upcoming earnings less about what companies say and more about how the stocks \"act.\" Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Investors are already expecting companies to cut earnings guidance, Lerner said.

      "content": "Tesla stock rises after Musk says time at DOGE will drop 'significantly' Tesla is navigating CEO Elon Musk's dwindling popularity, new EV competition, and the threat of auto tariffs. Pras Subramanian · Senior Reporter April 23, 2025 4 min read In this article: ^IXIC ^GSPC TSLA Tesla ( TSLA ) stock rose 3% in early trade Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more time at Tesla and less time in Washington, D.C., news that overshadowed a challenging quarter for the company that saw results come in far below Wall Street forecasts. \"Starting early next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] will drop significantly,\" Musk told investors on the company's earnings call. Musk said he'd continue to spend a day or two per week at DOGE, but said he will be \"allocating far more of my time\" to Tesla. \"While we would have preferred a full re-engagement with Tesla (as opposed to still sharing time with political efforts), we nevertheless believe the narrative should benefit from a re-engaged Elon on Tesla – simply, with Tesla more heavily focused on AV/AI, Elon is more important than ever to keep this narrative moving forward ... Elon is Tesla,\" Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients after the earnings call. Tesla reported first quarter revenue of $19.34 billion, below the $21.43 billion Wall Street was forecasting and the $21.3 billion reported a year ago, according to Bloomberg estimates. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, missing the $0.44 forecast by analysts. Adjusted profits in the quarter fell 40% from a year ago. Read more about Tesla's stock moves and Wednesday's market action. Tesla said plans for new affordable vehicles are on track for start of production in the first half of 2025 and that it still expects Robotaxi volume production starting in 2026. Along with Robotaxi testing, these were two big investor concerns heading into earnings. The company blamed trade uncertainty as a reason behind slumping sales. \"Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,\" the company said in a statement. \"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\" Musk said on the call that he told Trump that \"lower tariffs\" were better for the country but ultimately the decision on tariffs is up to the president. Because of this uncertainty, Tesla said it would revisit its 2025 guidance in its second quarter financial update and removed its long-term growth forecast. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet \"The key [trade] headwinds are: (1) Energy business is disproportionally affected by tariffs as TSLA sources the LFP batteries from China, (2) Volume guidance was temporarily paused due to tariff uncertainty, (3) China restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are employed in permanent magnets for electric motors, may negatively affect Tesla's business; (4) A relevant portion of manufacturing equipment is sourced from China,\" BofA analyst John Murphy noted in a research report. Story Continues Tesla said its first quarter gross margin hit 16.3%, better than the 16.1% expected, with automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits coming in at 12.5%. In the past, Tesla had promised to launch a lower-priced electric vehicle in the first half of 2025, along with other new vehicles that the company said would allow it to return to a 50% growth rate compared to 2023. Reuters reported on Friday that Tesla's plans to launch an affordable EV, which include a stripped-down version of the Model Y, have been delayed until later this year. Tesla has not responded to that report. Tesla execs on the call did not deny the Reuters report, saying only that the company was focusing on affordability and these efforts would resemble some of the existing Tesla models. The big concern for Tesla's bread-and-butter auto business is demand. Earlier this month, Tesla reported first quarter deliveries of 336,681 units making it the worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022. Conversely, rival automakers were seeing huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on April 2. Tesla's main rival overseas, BYD ( BYDDY ), has been eating into Tesla's market share for some time now. And President Trump's auto sector tariffs of 25% on foreign imports have automakers like Tesla in a bind. Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at at March 21 employee town hall. · X.com Demand concerns led to falling sales across a number of key regions for Tesla. Tesla registration data in key European regions fell in March , another sign that sales are continuing to slide as Tesla's brand has also taken a hit due to the right-wing political activities of CEO Elon Musk . Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe have seen Musk's and Tesla's brands suffer. Protests at Tesla showrooms in the US and abroad are growing, as are acts of vandalism on Tesla EVs. Musk added on the call that the company was focused on deploying Robotaxi testing in Austin in June, and claimed that Tesla's vehicles were significantly cheaper than Waymo's EVs, which he said contained expensive sensor suites.

Learn about our editorial policies Published April 21, 2025 10:19 AM EDT Artur Widak / NurPhoto via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Elon Musk must turn his attention away from his federal government cost-cutting efforts and refocus on the electric vehicle maker. Ives warned the company faces a \"code red situation\" without Musk changing course. Tesla is set to report earnings after the close of trading Tuesday. Tesla ( TSLA ) shares sank nearly 7% Monday after long-time bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities warned the electric vehicle (EV) maker faced a \"code red situation\" if CEO Elon Musk didn't back away from his service in the Trump administration and refocus on Tesla. Ives wrote in a note to clients that Musk is too distracted by his efforts to cut federal spending by leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. He said Musk \"needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.\" Ives pointed out that he remains bullish on the stock, and believes that Tesla and Nvidia ( NVDA ) are \"two of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years.\" However, Ives says that won't happen without Musk giving his full attention to the firm. He added that \"we are now at a major crossroads for the Tesla story.\" The automaker is scheduled to release its quarterly results after the close of trading Tuesday. Earlier this month, Ives slashed the price target on Tesla to $315 from $550, citing the U.S.-China trade spat plus the backlash against the company over Musk's involvement in the government's cost-reduction moves. He noted that it was a \"very bad thing\" that Tesla has \"become a political symbol globally.\" Shares of Tesla are down about 45% year-to-date.

The initiative, touted by Musk and President Donald Trump as a campaign to eliminate \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" has been called \"disruptive,\" \"chaotic\" and potentially irreversible by policy experts. Massive Layoffs, Mounting Lawsuits and Musk's Growing Backlash In March, DOGE was responsible for more than 275,000 announced federal job cuts, the highest single-month total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ? The cuts targeted multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Health and Human Services. On March 10, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X that the Trump administration had canceled 83% of USAID programs after a six-week review. Among those affected was 53-year-old division chief Katherine Ann Reniers who was only months away from securing her full pension. According to Business Insider , the loss reduced her retirement benefits by 50%, and she will now need to wait until age 62 to access them. According to The Guardian , roughly one-quarter of the HHS workforce was cut, totaling about 20,000 employees out of 82,000. The cuts hit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which administer the World Trade Center Health Program, particularly hard.The program provides care to first responders and survivors of the 9/11 attacks.

Here’s how everyday investors are getting started. The Financial Times reported that DOGE also cut 30 staffers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, including employees overseeing vehicle automation. Critics argued these layoffs could impair the agency's ability to regulate autonomous vehicle safety. In particular, Tesla (NASDAQ; TSLA), where Musk serves as CEO, remains under investigation over its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. ​Despite DOGE's mission to cut spending, U.S. expenditures have risen by $154 billion since Trump’s inauguration, compared to the same period in 2024 under then-President Joe Biden , according to The Wall Street Journal .

According to Reuters , DOGE allegedly used encrypted platforms like Signal and artificial intelligence tools to monitor federal workers' internal communications for perceived disloyalty. U.S. District judge Tanya Chutkan ordered Musk and DOGE to produce documents and answer questions regarding their federal spending reduction efforts. The director of the Center for Communication and Public Policy at Northwestern University, Erik Nisbet, said told HuffPost on April 3 that DOGE's approach had been \"very, very harmful — almost extra governmental.\" He compared its effects to \"a broke Humpty Dumpty,\" and questioned whether its damage could be undone.

      "content": "Tesla earnings: 2 things investors are looking for Madison Mills and Brad Smith April 21, 2025 In this video: TSLA Tesla ( TSLA ) stock is slipping Monday morning, just before the company is set to report its first quarter earnings on Tuesday. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson joins Morning Brief to discuss the top things Tesla investors are keeping an eye on: sales guidance indicating an auto sales rebound and more information on the company's planned full self-driving roll-out in June. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A the shares of Tesla down a little, uh, near four and a half percent this morning. What are you anticipating this week? 00:08 Garrett Nelson Sure, thanks for having me. There's really two areas, I think investors are going to be focused on. They're looking for clues that Tesla's auto sales will rebound from a very weak Q1 in which their sales, uh, deliveries were down 13% year-over-year. So, um, you know, what will the updated 2025 sales guidance look like? Last quarter, um, they lowered their guidance, uh, pretty significantly, now expecting only growth, uh, slight growth this year. So, um, I think analysts have really taken down their estimates. We're now forecasting a 10% drop in, uh, in sales volume this year. Uh, but that guidance is really going to be, um, I think the the number one thing that analysts are looking for. And then secondly, um, any information regarding the launch of their unsupervised full self-driving in the Austin market, uh, coming up in June. And, uh, as well as any update regarding, um, their future product pipeline. So those are really, I think the key things. 00:58 Speaker B Garrett, comparing the PE ratio for Tesla to the rest of the automobile industry right now. And and I know you kind of look across the entire automotive landscape and really assess what is different about all of these players right now. But Tesla is what? 300x some of the other PEs that we're seeing within this industry, within the sector. What is it that investors are going to be expecting going into this call to make that PE ratio justified? 01:40 Garrett Nelson Yeah, that's a great question. It's always traded at a massive premium to the rest of the industry though, and we think that's justified. So, um, I, you know, Tesla is of course, not only an auto company, but they're involved in energy storage, uh, a business which is growing a lot faster than the auto business and has higher margins, um, robotics, AI, um, as well as we think the the real value here is in the autonomous driving, the full self-driving software that they've continued to improve. And, uh, we'll really get a chance to showcase in in June. I think everyone is will be watching that. But, um, you know, I think Tesla has been really good the last few earnings releasing releases at diverting investor attention away from the various near-term challenges that they face. And there's no doubt they're they're facing some challenges. Uh, EV market share losses across their three major markets of the US, Europe, and China, um, slowing EV demand growth, both domestically and internationally, ongoing pricing pressures, and, uh, uh, you know, disappointing cyber truck volumes so far. So, and really diverting attention, um, keeping investors focused on longer-term catalysts. And so, uh, they've done a really good job at that. And, uh, so I think as much attention will be focused on the conference call as there is on the earnings release. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

      "content": "Jim Cramer Urges Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) to ‘Bring on the Humanoids’ Syeda Seirut Javed April 21, 2025 4 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Game Plan for Next Week: 25 Stocks in Focus . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. On Thursday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, walked viewers through what he described as an important week ahead for Wall Street, with earnings season hitting full stride and a flood of quarterly reports expected from companies spanning multiple sectors. “The fact is the president wants lower interest rates to help offset the pain from higher prices that  gonna be caused by the tariffs, but higher prices represent inflation.” READ ALSO: 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently . “The Federal Reserve never cuts rates when inflation’s out of control,” Cramer emphasized and added that it may very well become the case if tariffs continue to drive up costs. He made it clear that he respects Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he described him as a capable public servant who, in Cramer’s words, has “generally done a good job.” Still, he acknowledged Powell’s difficult position as he said the Fed chair is “stuck between a rock and a hard place.” He added: “Now history says he should be doing exactly what he’s doing, but history is now in the eye of the beholder and there’s only one beholder in this whole country and it ain’t Jay Powell.” While Cramer stopped short of diving deeper into political commentary, he admitted he is growing increasingly weary of the political noise surrounding monetary policy. As earnings reports begin to dominate the conversation, he highlighted how swiftly sentiment on Wall Street can shift based on results and noted that the market is entering a phase where “snap judgments” start flooding in after hours. “Here’s the bottom line: I know it’s supposed to be a terrible time, right? I mean like woo, scary, but I don’t know. The companies themselves they keep delivering and delivering, and you know what? I don’t think next week’s going to be any different.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 25 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 17. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Story Continues Jim Cramer Urges Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) to ‘Bring on the Humanoids’ Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Highlighting Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) upcoming earnings result, Cramer stated: “Now, no earnings season is complete without Tesla. Okay? It’s kind of like Netflix. Yeah, great number, Netflix, no kidding. People keep talking about how Tesla needs to redefine itself as a technology company replete with life-size robots and a game plan for the national rollout of self-driving cars. Without that, this is just some struggling EV play. Elon Musk, bring on the humanoids. It’s their time. Give them a break.” Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) builds and produces electric vehicles and energy products. The company sells cars, offers financing options, installs solar power systems, and provides energy storage devices. Overall, TSLA ranks 9th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock .

      "title": "Tesla must do these 3 on its earnings call, or else",
      "content": "Tesla must do these 3 on its earnings call, or else Brian Sozzi · Executive Editor April 21, 2025 In this video: TSLA You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , YouTube , or wherever you get your podcasts. With all due respect to JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Netflix ( NFLX ), the most important earnings report of the early earnings season will come on Tuesday by way of embattled Tesla ( TSLA ). The EV maker’s stock has been run over since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. It’s not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The public’s rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales. Meanwhile, Trump’s 145% tariffs on China risk Tesla getting the parts it needs to profitably grow a business like the Cybercab while also operating successfully in the country. “The turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,” tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock: Government exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla. Tariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trump’s tariffs on Tesla’s business. Turning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. The company may not be bloated cost-wise like typical turnarounds, but Musk has a lot to fix to get the top line back on track. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms Video Transcript 00:00 Brian Sozzi Welcome to Opening Bid here at the Nasdaq in Times Square. I'm Yahoo Finance Executive Editor, Brian Sozzi. I want to get to our stock of the day. And of course, that is Tesla. The company's earnings coming up on Tuesday evening. Stock's down about 43% since the inauguration of President Trump on January 20th. So many concerns, so many factors behind this plunge. But I have three. I have three things that I need to hear from Elon Musk on this company's earnings call. Not should hear, must hear. First up, government exit timeline. Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his Dodge role and get back to a hundred percent focus on Tesla. Need to hear it. Number two, tariff impact. Either Musk or his executives on this call need to quantify the financial impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, whether it's on components from China, whatever it is, they need to quantify this in terms of top-line impact and profitability impact. Investors need to hear this. And last, but not least, turning Tesla around. Musk must articulate, not should, must, must hear, what he is going to do to turn the company around. Whether he likes it or not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. Sure, they are not bloated cost-wise, like a lot of other automakers, or other turnaround stories, but it is a turnaround story nonetheless, because sales have fallen off a cliff, in many respects because of things he has done. And I am very excited for this Tesla earnings release, more so than normal. I'm always very excited, but this is going to be the first earnings call that you can listen to live on Yahoo Finance. It's a major new announcement from Yahoo Finance. You can now listen to earnings calls live on our platform. That is where I'll be on Tuesday night listening to Tesla's earnings call live on Yahoo Finance. I am so jazzed to see this feature. Shout out to our many people and teams at Yahoo Finance that made this happen. And of course, we just hit our one-year birthday on Opening Bid, and we have a special episode now on Yahoo Finance with former Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger. I've followed his entire Intel career, and he's giving me the Yahoo Finance exclusive on his time at Intel and what he's up to next. Appreciate all your support, appreciate all the love. We'll talk to you soon. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla TSLA, General Motors GM and Ford F Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog: Is Tesla a Buy Pre-Q1 Earnings? Investors Want These Answers First Electric vehicle (EV) and tech titan Tesla is slated to release first-quarter 2025 results on April 22, after market close. While Wall Street will focus on whether its earnings meet expectations, many investors are just as eager for CEO Elon Musk's answers to burning strategic questions. From progress on Full Self-Driving (FSD) updates and affordable EVs to updates on the Optimus robot and AI initiatives, the earnings call could provide much-needed clarity at a time when Tesla's stock is under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's earnings and revenues is pegged at 45 cents per share and $21.85 billion, respectively. The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised downward by 8 cents over the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection indicates no change from the year-ago quarter's levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 2.6%. For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA's revenues is pegged at $104.8 billion, implying a rise of 7.3% year over year. The consensus mark for 2025 EPS is pegged at $2.64, implying growth of around 9% on a year-over-year basis. In the trailing four quarters, Tesla missed EPS estimates thrice and beat once, with the average earnings surprise being 0.8%. Tesla, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tesla, Inc. Quote Q1 Earnings Whispers for Tesla Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla. The combination of a positiveEarnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That's not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. TSLA has an Earnings ESP of -11.69% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) Factors Shaping TSLA's Q1 Results In the first quarter, Tesla produced 362,615 (345,454 Model 3/Y and 17,161 other models) vehicles. It delivered 336,681 vehicles (323,800 Model 3/Y and 12,881 other models) globally. The deliveries not just missed our expectations of 409,584 units, they were down 32% and 13% on a sequential and yearly basis, respectively. In fact, the first-quarter 2025 deliveries marked the weakest numbers in more than two years. Story Continues Low sales volume, along with generous discounts on its offerings amid a stiff price war, is expected to have weighed on automotive revenues and gross margins. However, Tesla has been making progress in reducing its cost of goods sold, which might have somewhat offset the pressure. We expect first-quarter gross margins from automotive sales to fall from 17.8% in the year-ago quarter to 15.8%. On the positive side, Tesla's energy generation and storage business has been gaining traction. In the first quarter of 2025, the company deployed 10.4 GWh of energy storage products, up a massive 156% year over year. With strong demand for its Megapack and Powerwall products, revenues from this segment are estimated at $3.1 billion, implying a 90% increase year over year. Gross profit is expected to more than double. Tesla's Services/Other unit is forecast to generate $3 billion in revenues — up 32% year over year — driven primarily by its expanding supercharging network. Major auto biggies like General Motors and Ford are using Tesla's NACS charging standard, boosting the segment's outlook. Tesla Price Performance & Valuation Year to date, shares of Tesla have plunged roughly 40%, underperforming the industry, sector and S&P 500. The price performance also compares unfavorably with General Motors and Ford, which have lost 17% and 5%, respectively, in the same timeframe. YTD Price Performance Comparison From a valuation perspective, Tesla appears quite pricey. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 7.04, higher than the industry's 2.18. Tesla is also significantly overvalued relative to General Motors (P/S ratio of 0.25) and Ford (P/S ratio of 0.23). Musk's growing political involvement has dented brand appeal, with sales slowing in the United States, Europe and China. Disgruntled owners and increasing backlash have raised investor concerns. Big Questions That TSLA Investors Want Musk to Answer As Tesla gears up for its first-quarter earnings call, investors are eager for clarity on several hot topics. Will the company provide an update on the long-awaited unsupervised FSD and the much-hyped Cybercab? Is Tesla on track to launch its affordable models? With global tensions and tariffs on the rise, how is the company preparing to stay agile? There's also growing curiosity around the Optimus robot as Musk previously said it could generate over $10 trillion in revenues. Does he still believe that? And has Tesla made any moves to license FSD to rivals? Investors are all ears. How Should You Play TSLA Pre-Q1 Earnings? First things first. Tesla's core EV business is under pressure from competition and sluggish demand. The brand's shine isn't what it used to be. Musk's high-profile role in the Department of Government Efficiency has become a growing concern, fueling worries about his divided attention, especially at a time when Tesla is struggling with low sales and competition challenges. Tesla's long-term pitch now leans heavily on its autonomous driving ambition. For Tesla, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. It must prove that its AV technology works with no further delays. Progress in FSD approvals and robotaxi development will be critical. The company plans to roll out unsupervised FSD in Austin this June. Last month, it secured the first of several approvals required to eventually launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in California. Still, given recent delivery disappointments, valuation concerns and the potential for further near-term weakness, it may be wise for investors to wait for clarity from the first-quarter 2025 call before taking action. If results underwhelm—and Musk's commentary doesn't restore confidence—the stock could face more downside. Conservative investors may consider staying on the sidelines or even reducing exposure.

      "content": "Tesla's Weak Q1 Sets Stage for Strategic Reset, All Eyes on Musk Muslim Farooque April 21, 2025 1 min read In this article: TSLA Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) is gearing up to release its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and it's shaping up to be a pivotal moment. While analysts are expecting revenue to tick up slightly to around $21.5 billion, profit is expected to dip. Forecasts point to earnings per share falling to $0.42, down from $0.45 a year ago and well below the previous quarter's $0.73. The decline ties back to a tough quarter for deliveries just 336,681 vehicles made it to customers, the lowest figure in more than two years. That slump is setting the stage for what could be a tense earnings call. There's also growing pressure on Elon Musk to shift his attention back to Tesla. Analysts like Dan Ives at Wedbush have flagged concerns about Musk's outside commitments, especially as Tesla's brand has taken some hits and geopolitical factors like tariffs weigh on operations. Still, there's a longer-term view in play. Deepwater Asset Management is looking past 2025, betting on a rebound by 2026. That outlook hinges on stronger demand, a cheaper model, and real movement on Tesla's autonomy and robotics plans. Options markets suggest traders expect a big reaction, with implied volatility pointing to a possible 10% move after results drop. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

      "content": "Tesla Delays Launch of Cheaper, Stripped-Down Version of Model Y in US Zacks Equity Research April 21, 2025 4 min read In this article: TSLA Tesla, Inc. TSLA has delayed the launch of its long-anticipated affordable vehicle, which is a stripped-down version of its popular Model Y SUV, in the United States. The company previously pledged to release lower-cost cars in the first half of the year, aiming to rejuvenate lagging sales. Per sources, U.S. production of the cheaper Model Y, codenamed E41, will start later than originally planned, likely between the third quarter and early next year. The cause of the delay is unclear. Per sources, Tesla targets manufacturing 250,000 units of the more affordable Model Y in the United States by 2026. Production in China and Europe is also in the pipeline. These updated production plans and delays in the United States have not been publicly disclosed before. TSLA’s upcoming lineup of budget vehicles has generated significant interest among fans and investors, who hope that these vehicles will help reverse the company’s declining sales and shrinking market share. The automaker has also updated the current Model Y with design tweaks. The U.S. Long Range All-Wheel Drive version starts at around $49,000 before federal tax credits. Per Reuters, the E41 will debut in China in 2026 and is expected to be about 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y. There’s no confirmed timeline yet for a European release. Tesla is also working on a bare-bones version of its Model 3 compact sedan, per sources. The company hasn’t commented on the reported production delays or targets. Automakers like Tesla are facing challenges, including rising costs and supply chain disruptions, especially following a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts implemented by Trump. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Tesla has increased its use of North American parts in recent years. The company recently paused plans to ship parts for its Cybercab and Semi truck from China due to these tariffs. Tesla Scales Back Cybertruck Production Amid Weaker Sales Per Business Insider, Tesla is scaling back Cybertruck production goals. Cybertruck sales have slumped amid multiple recalls and investor concerns. Tesla has also reduced staffing on certain Cybertruck production lines. As of January, several workers from the Cybertruck section at the Texas Gigafactory were reportedly reassigned to work on the Model Y line. This restructuring reportedly began in December, after employees were surveyed about preferred job assignments. Cybertruck sales dropped to 6,406 units in the first quarter of 2025, down from 12,991 reported in the fourth quarter of 2024. Since its late 2023 launch, Tesla has sold just over 46,000 Cybertrucks. The company also saw a 13% decline in overall vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025. In March, TSLA halted Cybertruck deliveries due to concerns about side paneling detachment. Shortly after, it recalled all Cybertrucks, one of eight recalls since 15 months of production. To spur Cybertruck sales, Tesla now offers free lifetime charging for buyers of the $95,000 Foundation Series model, though the perk applies only to the original owner, not commercial drivers. To boost sales, Tesla introduced incentives and released a more affordable Cybertruck, costing about $70,000. This version reduces the price by $10,000 but comes with rear-wheel drive and omits features like air suspension and vegan leather seats. Story Continues Other Automaker Working on Affordable EVs Rivian Automotive, Inc. RIVN plans to expand its lineup with the R2, R3, and R3X, targeting budget-conscious buyers. R2, a midsize SUV, will be launched in early 2026 at a much lower price than the R1 models. The company expects R2 as a key growth driver, highlighting major cost savings in materials and production. Ford Motor Company F is set to reintroduce the base model Bronco for the 2025 lineup and has hinted at a new advertising campaign featuring the Maverick and Bronco Sport, two of its most affordable vehicles. The company is also committed to boosting production of the F-150's budget-friendly STX version, along with entry-level trims of the Escape and Explorer, to provide dealerships with a wider range of cost-effective options.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was down more than 2.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) sank 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped almost 2.4%, or nearly 1,000 points. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer notes , the stock market remains largely at the mercy of Trump's tariffs. Different headlines and shifts in narratives have driven big market swings over the past several weeks, with all three indexes down since Trump's \"Liberation Day\" event. Meanwhile, investors are grappling with a growing concern: Trump's bluster around removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell . Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for allegedly keeping interest rates too high, with his latest insult posted on Monday morning, warning that the economy could slow \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\" Trump's new focus on Powell comes after the Fed chief delivered a stark warning about the potential effects of tariffs on the economy.

The US dollar ( DX=F ) index sank to its lowest level since 2022, and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) rose back above 4.4%. Meanwhile the 30-year (^ TYX ) yield moved up to 4.9%. Earnings season continues, with this week looming as pivotal. Two of the \"Magnificent Seven\" take the spotlight of some 120 S&P 500 companies reporting this week: Elon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) and Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ). Tesla added to a whopping 40%-plus loss so far this year with a near-6% dive on Monday .

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) also sank more than 2.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped more than 900 points while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) fell more than 2.5% as high-growth tech stocks sold off.

Gold also rose to an all-time high above $3,430 per ounce as the US dollar slid. Mon, April 21, 2025 at 7:30 PM UTC Josh Schafer Big Tech earnings could reveal if stocks are 'washed out' — or if they have more room to fall With more than 100 S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) companies set to report first quarter financial results this week , investors will be closely listening to how individual outlooks are shaping up amid shifting policies from the Trump administration . Technology stocks, which have led the selling action during the tariff-induced market drawdown , will be in particular focus. Each \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is now off 23% or more from its most recent 52-week high. Given that the market has already sold off extensively over the past month , several Wall Street strategists have pointed out that simply watching how stocks react the day after a major earnings release will be a telling sign of whether the market has bottomed. Take Tesla ( TSLA ), for instance. A fair amount of bad news has already likely been priced into Tesla's stock, with disappointing deliveries for the quarter already known and 2025 annual earnings estimates already down about 20% in the past four months.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A Let's get to the three things that you need to know today. First up, US stock futures in the red to kick off the week amid growing concerns on Wall Street that President Trump is serious about his threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, sparking a selloff in the dollar and treasuries. The so-called sell America trade is gathering steam, sending gold to a record high. Meantime, Trump's trade war is in focus as China threatens retaliation against countries that are striking deals with the US that could hurt Beijing's interests. This comes as the Trump administration is reportedly planning to use tariff negotiations to pressure US partners to limit their dealings with China. Plus, earnings front and center for investors this week, with more than 140 companies out with results, including Tesla and Alphabet. Tesla will report after the bell Tuesday. Redbush analyst Dan Ives calling this a code red moment for the company if CEO Elon Musk doesn't take a step back from Doge and focus full time on the EV maker. And Google parent company Alphabet reports Thursday, bringing back into focus the AI trade and if Big Tech's AI investments are paying off. 02:05 Speaker B And Pope Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who became the first Roman Catholic pontiff from the Americas, has died. The Vatican making the announcement this morning, tributes pouring in from around the world. Francis made waves during his papacy as a reformer who often rattled the Catholic Church's most conservative quarters, but found popularity among progressives who embraced his championing of social justice efforts. His death comes after spending weeks in the hospital recently fighting pneumonia. Pope Francis was 88 years old. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

The bank said the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than 60% of the total dollar amount sold by hedge funds between Monday and Wednesday last week, indicating portfolio managers are not very positive about the companies' prospects. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla kicks off the Magnificent Seven's earnings season on April 22, followed by Alphabet two days later. All the Magnificent Seven stocks - which also include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Meta - are underperforming the S&P 500 index in 2025, with Alphabet down about 22% and Tesla off 44%. Overall, investors are cutting back their Magnificent Seven bets. A BofA survey showed that, while the megacap companies were considered the most crowded trade by almost 60% of investors, now only 24% see them as such. Currently, gold is considered the most popular trade by 49% of the respondents. Hedge funds also sold shares in the healthcare insurance, aerospace, defense, biotech, hotels, restaurants and leisure sectors last week, Morgan Stanley added.

Analysts expect a 6% year-over-year drop in profit to $0.42 per share, along with a modest 1% increase in revenue to $21.54 billion, reflecting slowing demand and ongoing operational challenges. Earlier this month, Tesla reported first-quarter vehicle deliveries of 336,681, well below the estimated 377,000. Vehicle production reached 362,615 units. About 4% of deliveries were structured under operating lease accounting, which affects how and when revenue is recorded. Despite the miss, analysts haven't lowered full-year delivery forecasts. Estimates remain steady at 456,000 for Q2, 497,000 in Q3, and 544,000 in the final quarter. Operational issues persist. Reports suggest Tesla has cut production targets across several Cybertruck lines and reassigned staff at its Texas Gigafactory. Some production areas are said to be running well below capacity. Meanwhile, delays have hit upcoming models like the Semi and Cybercab. The EV maker is also facing growing competition, particularly from Chinese firms such as BYD, and navigating shifting consumer trends. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

      "content": "Wall Street and the dollar tumble as investors retreat further from the United States Published: 2025-04-21 10:53:05 ET TSLA NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are tumbling Monday as worries about President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve cause investors pull further from the United States. The S&P 500 was 2.1% lower in morning trading and nearly 16% below its record set two months ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 726 points, or 1.9%, as of 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, while losses for Tesla and other Big Tech stocks had the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as a retreat continues from U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because the dollar has historically strengthened during past episodes of nervousness. But this time around, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening the dollar's reputation as a pillar of the global economy and one of the safest possible investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade over the weekend, even as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan have so far failed to reach a deal that could lower tariffs and help protect the economy, and they're seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network over the weekend. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which upped its own rhetoric against the world’s largest economy. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to help give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after it has slowed nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked again on Monday about a slowing for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates.” A move to fire Powell would likely send another bolt of fear through financial markets. While investors always love lower interest rates, because they boost prices for stocks and other investments, the larger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control in the long run. Such a move would further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. On Wall Street, several Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 6.7%, for example. The electric vehicle’s stock came into Monday roughly 50% below its record set in December on criticism that its stock price had gone too high and that its brand has become too entwined with Elon Musk, who’s leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending. On the winning side of Wall Street were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which jumped after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rallied 3%, and Capital One rose 0.9%. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors keep alive hopes that the Fed may cut its main overnight interest rate later this year in order to support the economy. Longer-term yields swiveled up and down, though, as doubts continue to rise about the United States' standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury topped 4.40% in the morning, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market. But it later regressed back to 4.34%. The U.S. dollar’s value, meanwhile, fell against the euro, Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and other currencies. In stock markets abroad, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%. Indexes fared better in Seoul, where stocks rose 0.2%, and in Shanghai, which saw a 0.4% gain. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "title": "At China auto show, EV makers to grapple with autonomous-tech crackdown, launch Tesla 'killers'",
      "content": "At China auto show, EV makers to grapple with autonomous-tech crackdown, launch Tesla 'killers' Published: 2025-04-21 03:24:04 ET TSLA SHANGHAI (Reuters) -More than 70 Chinese and international automotive brands will showcase more than 100 new or refreshed models at the Shanghai auto show this week, intensifying already cutthroat competition in the world's premier market for electric vehicles and hybrids. Top-selling Chinese brands such as BYD and Geely are expected to take centre stage at the show from April 23 to May 2, while foreign automakers such as Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota and General Motors' Cadillac brand will also jostle for attention. As a years-long consumer price war in China drags on, next-generation automated-driving features have become the next front in the battle for vehicle sales and profits. But automakers' plans to tout next-generation driver-assistance systems in Shanghai have been upended by a government crackdown on marketing claims using terms such as \"smart\" or \"autonomous\" to describe their technology after a fatal crash of Xiaomi SU7 in March. The Chinese electric sport sedan struck a cement pole and caught fire, killing three people, shortly after the driver tried to take over from the car's assisted-driving system. The launch of the SU7 shortly before last year's Beijing auto show created a sensation, and it has since sold more than 215,000 copies, outpacing Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis since December. The resulting government scrutiny has Chinese automakers such as BYD and Zeekr scrambling to revise their marketing presentations, veering away from boasts about automated-driving capabilities and instead emphasising driver caution. Driver-assistance systems have become a critical tool for automakers to differentiate themselves in China's crowded EV market. BYD, the nation's leading EV-and-hybrid maker, supercharged the competition in developing such systems after announcing in February it would offer its \"God's Eye\" driver-assistance system as free standard equipment across its lineup, including in entry-level models costing as little as about $10,000. BYD is following the same playbook with driver-assistance technology as it took with EVs - using its vast scale to drop the cost and pressure rivals, said Bo Yu, an analyst with auto industry research firm Jato Dynamics. Many automakers \"criticise BYD for the pricing war,\" she said. \"BYD is taking a similar strategy with God's Eye - making everyone else uncomfortable.\" China regulators in February also prohibited carmakers from installing over-the-air software updates to driver-assistance software without government approval. That prompted Tesla to halt a limited-time free trial of its \"Full Self Driving\" (FSD) software in China, which despite its name is not fully autonomous. Days later, it also dropped FSD from the name, calling it \"intelligent assisted driving\" instead. Tech giant Huawei, which supplies automotive software and has launched eight models in partnership with Chinese carmakers, on Tuesday launched a campaign urging caution when using its assisted-driving systems. At a livestreamed event last week for Huawei and Chery's jointly developed Luxeed brand, popular Chinese American actress Liu Yifei, a celebrity endorser of the brand, said: \"While the technology provides us with good assistance, we should also pay attention to driving safety.\" At the Shanghai auto show, Geely's Zeekr EV brand plans to launch its first model equipped with so-called Level 3 driver-assistance technology, meaning it can enable hands-off driving on highways and city streets but still requires drivers to watch the road. But its press conferences will now focus instead on showcasing hybrid models and battery technology, Zeekr said. Chinese regulators are also tightening EV-battery standards, aiming to reduce the risks of fires and explosions. TARGETING TESLA Regulatory challenges aside, China's \"new energy vehicle\" sector - including fully electric models and a wide variety of gasoline-electric hybrids - continues its historic sales surge. Electrified vehicles now account for more than half of all new-car sales in China, a far higher share than in the United States, Europe and almost all other global markets, and marking the achievement of a goal Beijing originally set for 2030. About a dozen new models to debut in Shanghai this week are electric crossovers priced to compete directly with Tesla's Model Y, potentially adding to the U.S. EV maker's mounting challenges in China and globally. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla has steadily lost market share in China, from a peak of 15% in 2020 of the country's battery-electric vehicle market to 9% in the first quarter and its annual sales declined globally for the first time last year. Those declines accelerated in Europe and the United States in the first quarter amid widespread public backlash over CEO Elon Musk's polarising politics as a top adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. Tesla has skipped China auto shows since 2021 after a protest by an unhappy customer at the site. The U.S. EV pioneer releases new models or redesigned models at a much slower pace than its Chinese competitors. Many of the Model Y competitors to debut this week offer more advanced battery-charging, assisted driving and in-car entertainment for a lower sticker price, such as Xpeng's G6 and Zeekr's E6. Xiaomi had been expected by some analysts to unveil its hotly anticipated YU7 crossover, deemed the biggest potential threat to the Model Y but it will instead only show its current SU7 and SU7 Ultra models at the show and has no plans to hold a press conference. It did not give a reason and did not respond to a request for comment. Independent automotive analyst Lei Xing, who has followed the rise of China's auto industry for two decades, called those and other formidable new Chinese electric crossovers \"Model Y killers.\" \"It's a tsunami of pressure\" on Tesla's best-selling model, he said. \"It's not going to be just one vehicle that beats the Model Y - it's 12 or 13.\" (Reporting by Victoria Waldersee and Zhang Yan in Shanghai; Additional reporting by Qiaoyi Li in Beijing; Editing by Brian Thevenot and Jamie Freed)"

That turnaround appears to be the result of several factors. Jessica Caldwell, head of market analysis at Edmunds, points to Elon Musk's polarizing public image, concerns about the depreciation of Tesla models, and a saturation of the brand in large cities. That first factor in particular, she says, weighs on customers' emotional attachment to the brand. The same data show that only 1.8 percent of potential car buyers considered a Tesla for their next car in February. That's the lowest level since October 2022. Interest in the brand appears to be steadily declining since its peak during the U.S. presidential election in 2024. New models are also struggling. Tesla sees its leading position in the electric car segment threatened by competitors such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and Kia EV9. For example, Chevrolet reported that Tesla's made up 11 percent of all trade-ins in March when buying their electric models. Impact on Tesla sales Edmunds predicts that this trend is likely to continue as Tesla owners pay off their loans and look for alternative brands. Although replacing a car is a major financial decision, growing dissatisfaction with Tesla may eventually prompt more owners to switch.

      "content": "This Midwestern city has long been a federal hub. The pain from DOGE’s cuts is everywhere Published: 2025-04-20 08:32:06 ET TSLA KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs. Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion. But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump’s administration. The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Not only me, but all these peoples’ lives are turned upside down,” Giagnorio said. The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy. With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries. An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout. A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood’s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded. The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic. A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market. And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk’s electric car company out of Missouri. The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families. “The poor will become even more poor now,” Giagnorio said. “If we’re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we’re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?” Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers. But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn’t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year. For now, she can’t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when? The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful. The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later. “It’s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what’s required of them,” said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers. By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week. Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies. Ellis said IRS workers share the public’s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she’s decided to take a “roll of the dice” and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer. “I love my job,” she said. “I’m not going to let the bully force me out.” Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century. Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers’ market serving the area. Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children. In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award “no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.” On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA’s decision. “What do you do if you don’t support providing access to food to people who don’t have it? Wouldn’t this make your job easier?” she said. “I think it’s absurd. It doesn’t make any sense.” Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising. At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City. “It just means giving families less food,” said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he’s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. “It’s as simple as that.” The Kansas City Health Department’s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.

      "content": "Is Tesla Stock a Buy Before April 22? By Justin Pope – Apr 19, 2025 at 4:56AM Key Points Elon Musk's politics could be affecting Tesla's brand. However, there are likely economic factors at play, too. The stock's ongoing decline has let hot air out of a ballooned valuation, but shares could fall further. Tesla is working through some things, so investors shouldn't feel rushed one way or the other. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.40 %) $ 15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET The company's upcoming earnings report has become a hot topic amid Elon Musk's political activities and soft Q1 deliveries. Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) has a big date coming up. The electric vehicle (EV), energy storage, robotics, and artificial intelligence company will release its first-quarter 2025 earnings report after the market closes on April 22. This is always a noteworthy event, a chance for investors to check a company's pulse. However, this could be one of Tesla's most significant earnings events in years. It will give investors an updated look at how CEO Elon Musk's political efforts might have affected the brand. And investors are eagerly awaiting updates on the company's looming Robotaxi service, which is supposed to be just months away. Should investors buy the stock before the earnings release on April 22? Here is what you need to know. Tesla's disappointing Q1 delivery numbers could have multiple causes Despite ambitions in robotics and self-driving technology, selling EVs still pays the bills. The company recently announced it delivered 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter. That number badly missed the market's expectations of 360,000 to 370,000 and represents a 13% decline from a year ago. Musk's commentary on the delivery figure will be among the top storylines of the earnings call. He has dived head-first into U.S. politics with his efforts to rein in government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency. Politics are divisive, and his efforts have sparked protests and vandalism against his cars and dealerships. Early research indicates that the brand has taken hits in markets like Europe and Canada. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.40 %) $ -15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.17 - $ 451.68 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 95M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A However, the economy could also be involved. Consumers are struggling in the U.S. right now. Auto loan delinquencies have skyrocketed, and consumer sentiment has plummeted since the start of the year. This is not conducive to people buying new vehicles. Politics seem to have affected Tesla's sales at this point, at least somewhat, but the soft first-quarter deliveries are probably not entirely politically driven, as they seem at first glance. The stock has declined nearly 50% Bad publicity and increased market volatility tend to hurt stock prices. Tesla peaked following the election in late 2024 but has declined nearly 50% over the past several months. Frankly, this drop could benefit long-term investors. As stomach-churning as steep price declines are, I sounded the alarm on Tesla's valuation months ago. That's not to brag, but to reference the valuation getting too far away from other automakers. The company is still overwhelmingly an auto business, so it's hard to justify such dramatic departures from a peer like Toyota Motor : TSLA EV-to-Revenue data by YCharts; EV = enterprise value. Admittedly, it's probably fair for Tesla to trade at a higher valuation than traditional automakers due to its exciting potential with its Robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robots on the horizon . However, they aren't here yet. The lower the valuation that investors pay, the more likely these potential catalysts will produce positive outcomes for them. The good news is that its enterprise value is now at a single-digit multiple on its revenue. Unfortunately, it could easily go lower from here, and its EV business is headed in the wrong direction, at least for this quarter. On the fourth-quarter earnings call , Musk said that the company is between growth phases as it ramps up production of the new Model Y, potentially launches a more affordable model this year, debuts its Robotaxi service, and prepares to manufacture Optimus robots and Cybercabs. Here is what investors should do heading into Q1 earnings on April 22 Given how much commotion there is with Tesla, internally and externally, there is more uncertainty surrounding an already polarizing company and stock. Steep declines like it is experiencing can be buying opportunities for long-term investors. Still, it's probably wise to let the dust settle. The core business appears to be struggling, and launching its Robotaxi service in a limited fashion later this year won't change that. The stock is arguably still expensive, so it could easily slide further if the market remains shaky. Investors should consider holding off for now. See what Tesla's first-quarter earnings report has to say and what Elon Musk says about the state of things on the earnings call. Then, after digesting everything, formulate a plan to accumulate shares slowly if you believe the company is on the right track. It's OK to move slowly and methodically.

      "content": "The patriotic spending spree that risks leaving us all poorer Tim Wallace 19 April 2025 6 min read In this article: TSLA -3.40% In Canada, stores have cleared shelves of bourbon and wine from south of the border - REUTERS/Chris Helgren A Tesla smashed in London. Shelves cleared of American booze in Canada. Holidays to the US cancelled en masse. Donald Trump appears to have succeeded in reordering world trade – just not in the way he hoped. The US president wanted his trade war to trigger lower imports, boost exports and bolster American manufacturing. Instead, an international “buyers’ strike” is emerging as grass roots groups and politicians pledge to buy local and boycott American goods. The president seems to have forgotten that it is generally businesses and their customers whose decisions dictate large shares of world trade flows, not government diktats. And those customers are distinctly unhappy with claims they and their compatriots are “pathetic” and have “looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered” the US. Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and make Canada the 51st state, as well as the insults and bitter complaints about allies, have sparked consumer backlash across the world. In Canada, stores have cleared shelves of bourbon and wine from south of the border. American brewers and distilleries are poised to lose the best part of C$1bn (£544m) of annual sales in Ontario alone, where the Liquor Control Board has blocked new orders of American booze. The Salling Group, a Danish supermarket chain, has not removed American goods from its shelves, but has put star-shaped stickers on European-made products to encourage people to buy local. Anders Hagh, its chief executive, said the decision followed “a number of inquiries from customers who want to buy groceries from European brands”. More than 70pc of British shoppers plan to spend more on products from UK businesses amid the trade war, according to a survey by Barclays. Just over a third of Germans say they will reject American products, with almost two thirds pledging to avoid specific brands such as Tesla, according to research group ECC Köln. China has taken a more direct route and simply blocked the import of Boeing aeroplanes . Economists at Goldman Sachs are taking the threat seriously. They have downgraded their forecasts for US growth in part because foreign customers are turning their backs on America. Joseph Briggs at the investment bank said the “tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the US”, with boycotts set to hold back the economy’s growth. Where boycotts will hit home The most critical impact might come via travel – or the lack thereof. Flights to the US from almost every region have plunged, with particularly big drops in visits from Canada , Mexico and Denmark, but also the UK. Story Continues James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING, says: “We are seeing airline fare prices fall quite substantially in America, and hotel prices are coming down as well. “You’ve got a 30pc drop in tourism coming through potentially, that means less hotels, less flights, less eating out, less shopping, all of which can have an impact on the US.” The most high-profile victim of this buyers boycott has been Tesla , whose image has become toxic as a result of chief Elon Musk’s proximity to Trump. Sales in the EU so far this year have been cut in half compared with the opening months of 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Shares in Tesla are down almost 50pc from December’s peak in response. Despite the car-smashing stunt in the UK, sales in Britain appear relatively unaffected: so far this year they are up 6pc, almost matching the 6.4pc growth in the overall car market. Reality of ‘Buy British’ A rise in patriotic spending is political – consumers want to boost their home economies and punish the US. But there is a risk that it could backfire. Tesla has a giant factory in Germany, so European manufacturing that will bear some of the hit from lower sales on the Continent. A sustained rejection of American goods could also hurt Britain. “It is about consumer choice,” says Neil Shearing, at Capital Economics. “Think about the UK in the 1970s. The car industry was notorious for poor quality cars produced by UK firms. Then you got an influx of Japanese cars in the 1980s. Suddenly, not only does the relative price come down because of competition, but the quality goes up.” Rachel Reeves made exactly this point when rejecting calls for a “buy British” campaign. “If every country in the world decided that they wanted only to buy things produced in their country, that would not be a good way forward,” the Chancellor said. “Our country has benefited hugely from access to global markets, and we will continue to want to be able to do that, because that is in our national interest.” Some US products are also difficult to avoid. Britain imported £15bn of fuels from the US last year, for instance. Nobody at the petrol pump questions the source of the fuel being poured into their tank. Similarly liquefied natural gas (LNG) from America was a lifeline in the energy crisis, and the UK bought £2.5bn of gas from the States last year. Not many people are turning down their radiators or buying a heat pump to prevent some slice of their bills going to the US energy industry. Avoiding foreign goods is tough, says Shearing, noting that almost all advanced semiconductors are made in Taiwan, for example. There is little prospect of Britain ever developing a cutting-edge chip industry. iPhones are not going to be made in Britain, nor are mass-market trainers. Brace for backlash Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, has launched a “buy Canadian” campaign intended to boost patriotic spending. But elsewhere, there is little political enthusiasm for such campaigns. Britain’s equivalent is limited to the Liberal Democrats. Daisy Cooper, the party’s Treasury spokesman, said Britain must support hard-pressed businesses in the face of the trade war. “We have to speak the only language that Trump understands – the language of strength – and help them save thousands of jobs,” she says, calling on the Government to launch a full campaign to “buy local, back Britain”. “Buying British is just one of the ways we can all show our support whilst also sending a message that we won’t take Trump’s tariffs lying down.” Ironically for a president who wants to reduce trade deficits, Trump could instead pump them up by driving away tourists in the US and prompting consumer boycotts across the globe. “The trade balance could actually deteriorate significantly this year,” says Knightley. “In the first half of the year it is because imports are surging because US companies are trying to get ahead of the tariffs. And from now on we could see a decline in US export demand. “It is not just tariffs, but his antagonism to other countries, be it Canada as the 51st state, taking over Greenland, berating Europe in terms of being weak, perceived support for Russia – all of these factors are culminating in potentially an ‘avoid America’ narrative.” In turn, that risks enraging Trump and pushing him to launch more tariffs. Brace for backlash after backlash, which risk leaving us all poorer. Terms and Privacy Policy Your privacy choices"

Not marginally — dramatically. Even 1% of his net worth is more than most people could spend in multiple lifetimes. But in a 2022 post on X, Musk pushed back on the idea that Tesla operates like a traditional hierarchy. \"Everyone eats same food, uses same restrooms, etc — no executive chef or other ivory tower stuff,\" he wrote. \"There shouldn't be this workers vs management two-class system. Everyone is a worker.\" Don't Miss: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Invest in the future of digital engagement: Own a piece of the $100 billion Metaverse for just $500 . Now in 2025, and Musk is still fighting to reinstate a $56 billion Tesla compensation package that was struck down last year by a Delaware court. The court's decision was grounded in findings that the package was negotiated by directors lacking independence from Musk and that shareholders were misled by flawed disclosures during the approval process. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick described the compensation as an \"unfathomable sum\" and highlighted the undue influence Musk had over the board, noting close personal ties with several directors . Meanwhile, factory workers at Tesla's plants in Texas and Nevada are reportedly earning as little as $22 an hour. Even at the top of the pay scale, hourly wages max out around $39, Business Insider reported last year. Trending: With shares starting at $1.52, this could be your chance to invest in the future of healthcare . According to Tesla's proxy statement, Musk appeared to take home nothing in 2022—at least on paper. The company reported his total compensation as zero for the year, which technically brought the CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio down to 0:1. But that snapshot doesn't tell the whole story. Just one year earlier, in 2021, Musk exercised a massive batch of stock options that were set to expire, realizing gains of $23.45 billion. Tesla's filings show his \"total realized compensation\" for 2021 was $734,762,107, and based on the median employee salary of around $40,000 that year, the pay ratio came out to 18,043 to 1. Story Continues Musk's supporters argue that his compensation was performance-based and tied to milestones that drove massive value for shareholders. Critics point out that while Tesla's valuation soared, the workers powering its growth haven't seen the same rewards — and in some cases, have even seen wages reduced. The legal battle over Musk's record-breaking pay is ongoing. But so is the conversation about whether Tesla really operates without a two-class system — or whether that idea only works in theory, not on the assembly line.

      "content": "Exclusive-Tesla to delay US launch of affordable EV, a lower-cost Model Y, sources say FILE PHOTO: A guest takes photos of Tesla Model Y, displayed during the inauguration ceremony of first Tesla showroom, in Riyadh · Reuters Abhirup Roy, Aditi Shah, Hyunjoo Jin April 18, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA By Abhirup Roy, Aditi Shah, Hyunjoo Jin SAN FRANCISCO/NEW DELHI/SEOUL (Reuters) -Tesla's long-awaited plans for an affordable car include a U.S-made, stripped-down version of its best-selling electric SUV, the Model Y, but the production launch has been delayed, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Tesla has promised affordable vehicles beginning in the first half of the year, providing a potential boost to flagging sales. Global production of the lower-cost Model Y, internally codenamed E41, is expected to begin in the United States, the sources said. That would occur at least a few months later than outlined in Tesla's public plan, they added, offering a range of revised targets from the third quarter to early next year. The reason for the delay was not clear. Two of the people said Tesla aimed to produce 250,000 of the cheaper Model Ys in the United States in 2026. The new vehicle is also planned for eventual production in China and Europe, Reuters has previously reported. The delay of U.S. production and the U.S. production target have not been previously reported. Tesla reports results on Tuesday, and plans for the new vehicles are a major question. The less expensive mass-market vehicles have been widely anticipated by Tesla fans and investors who hope they will attract a fresh group of customers and reverse the EV maker's falling sales and eroding market share. Tesla also has refreshed its original Model Y with exterior and interior changes. The Long Range All-Wheel Drive version in the United States costs about $49,000, before a $7,500 federal tax credit. Reuters reported last month that the China launch of the E41 will occur in 2026. The E41 will be smaller and cost 20% less to produce than the refreshed Model Y, the sources familiar with China plans told Reuters. The timing of the rollout in Europe is not clear. Tesla is also planning to launch a bare-bones version of its Model 3 compact sedan, three people said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the delay of production of the cheaper Model Y, production targets and other details reported here. The EV maker on Jan. 2 reported its first decline in annual deliveries last year, and analysts expect sales to fall again this year for several reasons, including damage to the brand reputation by Chief Executive Elon Musk's close work with U.S. President Donald Trump and support of far-right European politicians. Another challenge for Tesla is that its vehicles are aging and there is no relatively cheap model. Story Continues Musk earlier promised a new, cheaper EV platform with cars expected to be priced as low as $25,000, but dropped that to prioritize robotaxi development. Automakers are grappling with prospects of rising prices and supply-chain disruption, after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported from outside the United States. Tesla has increased North American sourcing for parts of many models over the last two years, which would decrease tariff exposure for the E41, two people aware of the matter said.

      "content": "Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Among the Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2025? Fatima Gulzar April 18, 2025 6 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of 12 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other best EV stocks to buy in 2025. Electric cars, often known as electric vehicles or EVs, are automobiles powered by electricity instead of gas. Electric car stocks are comprised of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. Firms that make components for electric vehicles, such as batteries or autonomous driving systems, are also regarded as part of the electric vehicle industry. President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported automobiles have officially come into force, affecting roughly half of the US auto industry. According to S&P Global Mobility estimates, 46% of the 16 million automobiles sold in the United States in 2024 were not produced domestically. The policy also includes tariffs on specified vehicle parts, including engines and transmissions, which will go into effect on May 3. Wall Street analysts and investors have been skeptical of the tariffs, which some say might reduce business earnings and plunge the automobile industry into a recession. Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska stated in a recent note to investors: “A 25% on automotive imports lasting beyond four to six weeks would likely have a chilling effect on the entire sector as [automakers] need to grapple with significant impact to the bottom line.” Wall Street analysts believe that automakers’ and suppliers’ equities will remain volatile in the near term. The most vulnerable businesses are those with high import ratios. Several companies saw more than 60% of their U.S. sales in 2024 come from vehicles manufactured outside of the United States. Meanwhile, companies with all-U.S. final assembly lines and minimal dependence on imports, especially in the EV industry, are projected to be more secure. In the first quarter, U.S. auto sales exceeded industry forecasts by a wide margin as buyers rushed to purchase new cars before the tariffs went into effect, which many believe will raise car prices. According to S&P Global Mobility’s tariff analysis, the costs of importing vehicles, auto manufacturing in the US, and consumer vehicle costs will all rise. Analysts warn that if tariffs are completely implemented, typical new car prices, which are currently around $48,000, might rise by up to $10,000. Lower-margin, entry-level vehicles are more vulnerable to price increases or discontinuation since they are often sourced from low-cost countries and are prone to margin compression under the new tariff regime. Story Continues Specifically, China’s car exports are under strain as US tariff hikes impact major overseas markets. Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), stated: “The abrupt hike in U.S. tariffs will have a disastrous impact on economies such as Southeast Asia, and thus our exports to these markets will be impacted more than expected.” March exports dipped 8% year on year, following a rise of 11% in February. Joint ventures and luxury brands suffered a 45% decline, exporting only 47,000 units. Exports from Shanghai-based EV facilities fell 82.4% in March to 4,701 units, while first-quarter exports fell 56.9% to 38,147 vehicles. The China Passenger Car Association fears that Southeast Asia, which is significantly touched by new US tariffs, may witness a decline in demand. Export growth was originally projected to slow to 10% in 2025, down from 25% in 2024, but this could potentially fall. Domestic sales surged by 14.4% to 1.97 million units in March and 6.1% to 5.18 million in the first quarter. 12 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2025 Methodology We sifted through EV ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of the 20 Best EV stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 1,009 hedge funds in Q4 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 After delivering nearly 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, Elon Musk’s electric car company continues to command respect as a force propelling the EV industry forward, with a top-line revenue of $89 billion. The majority of the vehicles were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, while the remainder were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s older, more expensive versions. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, the firm continues to aggressively grow production. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s factories in Texas and Germany are now ramping up production, while a second factory in Mexico is under construction. The business has resorted to price cuts to sell vehicles this year as consumer demand has weakened, a decision that has harmed the company’s bottom line. In 2024, its overall gross margin fell 39 basis points year on year to 17.9%, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin fell marginally to 17% from 17.2% in 2023. The business is still profitable, but profits are falling. Regardless of Elon Musk’s role as CEO, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is clearly a leader in the worldwide EV market and the Best EV Stock . The company’s shares have recently performed well, with low overseas exposure due to domestic EV production, according to Schwab Network Correspondent George Tsilis. He acknowledges supply chain problems but views Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as rather resilient. A positive China-U.S. resolution may increase market risk appetite. Overall, TSLA ranks 1st on our list of the 12 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2025 . While we acknowledge the potential of EV companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

      "content": "Jim Cramer on Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): More Pain to Come Before the Bounce Syeda Seirut Javed April 18, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Put These 6 Stocks Under the Microscope . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. On Wednesday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on how companies are grappling with the challenge of issuing guidance during the earnings season. “So far this earnings season, the great dilemma is how the heck are you supposed to deal with your guidance? How do you come up with a forecast when you got no idea what the future’s going to look like? I don’t have it. You don’t have it. They don’t have it.” READ ALSO 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently Cramer pointed to a series of recent developments that have added to the uncertainty. Among the most disruptive, he said, is the sudden rollout of a sweeping tariff policy, which includes a 10% base tariff on all imported goods. It has triggered retaliatory measures from several trading partners. Cramer mentioned that China has stopped accepting deliveries of Boeing aircraft. On top of that, he noted a noticeable decline in international tourism. “The whole thing’s a bit of a mess,” he said. He added: “So aside from purely domestic companies with little economic sensitivity, how on earth can executives give you any kind of forecast for 2025 here? Coming into earnings season, I figured most of them would just simply pull their outlooks. I mean, who could blame them?” As the earnings season is underway, however, Cramer said he is seeing a variety of responses. Some companies, especially the major banks, are opting to reiterate their full-year outlooks. But he noted that these institutions generally do not issue detailed guidance on metrics like revenue or earnings per share in the first place. Meanwhile, several companies have managed to surpass Wall Street’s expectations for the quarter, only to stick with previously issued full-year forecasts. “But here’s the bottom line: With earnings season in full swing, I’m surprised more companies haven’t pulled their full year forecast like Delta. The most common strategy that’s been seen so far is beat and maintain from a handful of companies like the banks and a couple of healthcare companies holding up so far.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 16. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Jim Cramer on Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): More Pain to Come Before the Bounce Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Inquiring about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), a caller asked if Cramer thought that all the bad news was priced in. He replied: “Do I think all the bad news is already priced in? What a great question. You know what? I’ll tell you that with the stock down 40%, when this stock’s down 50%, that’s when I feel, because that’s at the level where people just say, I’ve had it. So let’s take a, you know, a little bit more, little bit more pain and then some gain there.” Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, builds, and sells electric cars and energy products. The company offers different services that include selling vehicles, offering financing plans, and providing solar power systems and energy storage solutions. ClearBridge Investments stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2025 investor letter : “Our active underweight to the Magnificent Seven added more than 100 basis points to relative returns for the quarter, with underweights to EV maker Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Google parent Alphabet being among the largest relative contributors. We added to both positions, taking advantage of what we view as short-term weakness as Alphabet missed high expectations for cloud revenue growth in its latest quarter, while Tesla worked through negative sentiment over CEO Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration.” Overall, TSLA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Tariffs Described As 'Armageddon' For The Sector Madison Troyer April 18, 2025 4 min read In this article: TSLA AAPL GOOG AMZN Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google, Tesla, and Apple gave millions of dollars to Trump during his campaign and for his inauguration Now the businesses have lost a collective $1.8 trillion, thanks to reciprocal tariffs Wedbush's Dan Ives called the levies an \"economic armageddon\" for the tech sector Several Silicon Valley leaders were among President Donald Trump 's biggest supporters during the election and his inauguration. Now, they're seeing their wallets take a major hit thanks to his policies. Apple (NASDAQ: APPL ), Meta (NASDAQ: META ), Google, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) gave millions of dollars to Trump's reelection campaign and inauguration fund. But CNN now reports that as of April 9, the companies have lost a combined $1.8 trillion due to tariffs.

How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy . Throughout his campaign, Trump talked about how eager he was to grow the tech industry and cement America as a leader in AI. So it follows that the country's tech giants would want to hitch their trains to Trump's. But with tariffs targeting supply chains and manufacturing hubs across Asia, those once-hoped-for business benefits have failed to materialize. In their place are substantial monetary losses for both the companies and their respective CEOs and founders. Investment bank UBS now estimates that tech earnings as a whole could shrink by as much as 19%, according to a daily update it released on April 5. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called Trump's tariff policies an \"economic armageddon\" for the sector in an April 3 interview on CNBC . Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. But what do those losses look like for the individual companies and the billionaires behind them? According to CNN, Elon Musk has been hit the hardest. On April 12, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed that the Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency de facto leader's personal net worth had dropped by $121 billion since the start of the year. And CNN writes that as of the market close on April 9, Tesla shares were down by 28% and its market capitalization had dropped by $376.6 billion. Story Continues Following the market rebound on April 9, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's net worth had gone down by $14.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg list. This is a significant bounceback from the initial $26.5 billion loss that CNN reported the day before. His shrinking fortune still pales in comparison to the 2.25% loss in Meta's stock prices, which has caused a $35.8 billion decrease in the company's valuation. Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has seen a $33.3 billion decline in his net worth, according to Bloomberg, while CNN reports that his company experienced a 13% share price drop since the start of the year, which translates to a $316.8 billion loss in value. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now . And while Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook have seen their personal fortunes take less of a hit, their companies have not profited from their association with Trump the way they may have hoped. Google donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, but has seen tariffs contribute to a 16.2% drop in its stock prices and a $386.7 billion decline in its valuation, according to CNN. And Apple, having pledged a $500 billion investment in U.S. facilities, has taken an especially big hit, with stock prices hitting a low of 18.5% down from the start of the year, and total valuation declining by $684 billion. During Trump's first term in office, many big companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Tesla successfully lobbied for exemptions from Trump's tariffs. But this time around, things appear less certain for the tech giants. \"The magnitude of reciprocal tariffs levied by the U.S. poses profound financial risks to the technology industry and its extensive supply chain,\" Moody's Ratings wrote in a note on April 8. \"We believe no tech industry subsector will go unharmed.\" Read Next: Maker of a life-changing asthma device with 12,000+ patients waiting, FDA clearance, and a 67% drop in attacks — now taking final investors at just $1.52 per share.

      "content": "Busy US earnings week confronts market grappling with tariff fallout Lewis Krauskopf April 18, 2025 4 min read In this article: GOOG TSLA ^GSPC By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) -A heavy slate of U.S. company results in the coming week will test a stock market shaken by a U.S. trade policy overhaul that upended the outlook for the global economy and corporate America. Investors remain on edge after President Donald Trump's sweeping April 2 tariff announcement stunned markets and sparked some of the most volatile trading since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago. After rebounding somewhat last week, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell this week and was down 14% from its February record high. Volatility levels moderated from five-year peaks but remain elevated by historic measures. Tesla and Google parent Alphabet - two of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap companies whose shares have faltered after two years of stock leadership - are among those closely watched for financial results as investors seek guidance about the fallout from tariffs that are very much in flux. \"The view of the CEOs going forward has never been more important,\" said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America and president of online broker Tastytrade. Companies and investors are grappling with a tariff landscape poised to keep shifting as the Trump administration negotiates with other countries. While he has paused some of the heftiest levies on imports, the U.S. is also locked in a trade battle with China, the world's second-largest economy. Economists polled by Reuters this week put odds of a recession in the next year at 45%, up from 25% last month. In one corporate report this week that caught the attention of investors, United Airlines laid out two scenarios for the year, including one warning of a significant hit to revenue and profit if there is a recession. United's dual forecast provided a type of \"roadmap\" by acknowledging and quantifying risks, said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at Evercore ISI. \"Putting parameters on what may unfold is how stakeholders ... make decisions in an environment where traditional guidance is bound to be considered relatively unreliable,\" Emanuel said in a note on Thursday. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla, which reports results on April 22, is in the spotlight in part because of the billionaire's close ties to Trump. Alphabet will be watched for any detail on advertising spending and capital expenses tied to artificial intelligence capacity, as investors scrutinize AI project costs. The company was dealt a setback on Thursday, when a judge ruled Google illegally dominates two markets for online advertising technology. Story Continues All the Magnificent Seven megacap stocks are sharply lower in 2025, with Alphabet down about 20% and Tesla off 40%. The Magnificent Seven \"led everything to the upside,\" Kinahan said. \"If they can't continue to perform, I think it gives people a pause overall, especially as we're looking for footing after the last couple of weeks.\" Boeing's results are also in focus, after China reportedly ordered its airlines not to take further deliveries of the planemaker's jets. IBM, Merck, Intel and Procter & Gamble are among the major U.S. companies set to post results in the coming week. Projections for U.S. profit growth have pulled back, with S&P 500 earnings estimated to rise 9.2% in 2025, down from the 14% gain estimated at the start of the year, according to LSEG IBES data. Investors are bracing for even greater contraction as companies report results and account more for the tariffs. The market's attention was also on the Federal Reserve, after Trump on Thursday said Fed Chair Jerome Powell's termination \"cannot come fast enough,\" while calling for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates. A day earlier, Powell said the Fed would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing rates. Investors will be hoping that the heart of earnings season can restore more calm to markets. The Cboe Volatility index, an options-based measure of investor anxiety, hit around 60 in the aftermath of Trump's tariff announcement, but has since pulled back to about 30. Still, that level is well above its long-term median level of 17.6, according to LSEG Datastream. Ayako Yoshioka, senior investment strategist at Wealth Enhancement, said the index would need to recede to the \"mid-teens in order to say maybe that volatility has subsided a little bit.\" If it stays around 30, Yoshioka said, \"it doesn't mean we're out of the woods.\" (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Richard Chang) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

He is an experienced journalist who has covered everything from the latest in business and tech news to sports and international news like the war in Ukraine for respected outlets like Business Insider and Newsweek. Learn about our editorial policies Updated April 22, 2025 11:35 AM EDT Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Tesla will report first-quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday as analysts remain divided on the electric vehicle maker. Revenue and adjusted profits are expected to fall year-over-year as deliveries and production have disappointed. The EV maker's stock has suffered as the company has been the center of protests and controversy over CEO Elon Musk's political efforts. Tesla ( TSLA ) is scheduled to post its first-quarter earnings report after Tuesday's closing bell. Analysts are divided on the electric vehicle maker leading up to the results. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha are split between 10 \"buy\" ratings, four \"hold,\" and four \"sell\" ratings. Ahead of last quarter's report, the distribution was nine \"buy,\" six \"hold,\" and three \"sell\" ratings. The mean price target, $310 per Visible Alpha data, represents a roughly 36% premium to its close on Monday—but that average target is down about $52 from the average prior to last quarter's earnings. Tesla is expected to report a less than 1% decline in revenue to $21.1 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) forecast to fall by nearly 8% year-over-year to $0.41. The revenue estimate has been cut 17%, while the adjusted EPS consensus has fallen by over 40% since last quarter's report was released. Deliveries, Production Fell Short Amid Political Concerns Last week, Reuters reported that the company has paused shipments of parts from China for its semi trucks and Cybercab autonomous taxi because of the Trump administration's tariffs, potentially delaying production and release of the vehicles. The company's deliveries and production numbers fell short of estimates for the second straight quarter when they were released earlier this month. The EV maker has also been the center of protests and controversy regarding CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration. Sales have declined in several key markets so far this year. Tesla stock was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 in the first quarter. Analysts, including those most bullish on the EV maker, have cut estimates for deliveries and profits this year, along with price targets. Some have called for Musk to step back from his political efforts to focus on Tesla as the stock has slid. Tesla shares have roughly returned to their pre-election levels around $240, falling from a Dec. 17 record close of $479.86.

      "content": "Modi, Musk discuss potential for India-US technological collaboration Published: 2025-04-18 05:25:05 ET TSLA New Delhi, Apr 18 (EFE).- India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US magnate and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk, spoke on Friday and discussed the potential for collaboration between New Delhi and Washington in the areas of technology and innovation. \"Spoke to @elonmusk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation,\" the Indian prime minister said in a message posted on X, owned by Musk. \"India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,\" he added. In February, the Indian prime minister, seen as a figure close to US President Donald Trump, visited Washington and met with Musk. Modi and the DOGE director, who is also CEO of the automaker Tesla and the aerospace company SpaceX, then discussed topics such as space, mobility, technology and innovation, as well as artificial intelligence and sustainable development. The Indian government has previously expressed interest in Tesla setting up a factory on its territory to manufacture electric vehicles under the \"Made in India\" policy. However, the North American company said it preferred to explore the market before investing in the South Asian giant. The conversation between Modi and Musk comes two days after Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal met in New Delhi with a delegation from the satellite internet company Starlink, also owned by the South African-born tycoon, to learn about the company's future investment plans in the Asian country, where it is negotiating its entry. Furthermore, the dialogue between Modi and Musk takes place in the midst of a pause in the reciprocal tariffs of 26 percent imposed by Trump on India, a major trading partner of Washington, a figure much lower than those imposed on other Asian countries. Negotiating a free trade agreement between India and the US is now the goal of the Modi and Trump administrations, which aim to smooth over trade differences before the end of the tariff pause. Between Apr. 21-24, US Vice President JD Vance will visit India, where he is scheduled to meet with Modi and other Indian officials. EFE © 2025 EFE News Services (U.S.) Inc., source EFE Ingles"

      "content": "Stocks to watch this week: Tesla, Alphabet, Intel, Boeing and Unilever Earnings preview of key companies reporting this week and what to look out for Vicky McKeever and Brian McGleenon 18 April 2025 11 min read In this article: DELHY DLVHF IHCPF TSM TSMWF As the latest earnings season gets well underway, there are a range of big-name companies due to report in the coming week. Two Magnificent 7 companies are reporting next week, with Elon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) due to release results on Tuesday, followed by Google-parent Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ) on Thursday. Another tech stock in focus next week will be Intel ( INTC ), with investors keen to see more detail on how new CEO Lip-Bu Tan plans to turn the troubled chipmaker around. US planemaker Boeing ( BA ) is another company slated to report, with investors waiting to find out more on how the company could be impacted by escalating trade tensions. In a shortened week for UK markets, which are closed for the Easter bank holiday on Monday, Unilever ( ULVR.L ) is due to report on Thursday. Here's more on what to look out for: Tesla ( TSLA ) – Releases first quarter results on Tuesday 22 April Shares in Tesla ( TSLA ) have slumped 37% year-to-date, as the electric vehicle company's sales have declined in different countries and backlash against CEO Elon Musk has grown. Earlier in April, Tesla reported first quarter global deliveries that widely missed estimates. For the quarter, Tesla reported 336,681 deliveries compared to expectations of 390,342, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates, making it the worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022. Read more: Stocks that are trending today Protesters have gathered at Tesla showrooms around the world to demonstrate against Musk's political activities, in heading up US president Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and overseeing cuts to government agencies. \"Tesla comes into results as arguably the most scrutinised company in the world,\" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"That’s not really a position investors want to be in, and there’ll be a lot of focus on whether Elon Musk gives any indication of when he might be stepping back from DOGE. A return to business as usual would be welcomed with open arms. Investors will also be looking for some clarity on more affordable vehicles and any updates on the imminent launch of the robotaxi service in June.\" Shares in Tesla have slumped 37% year-to-date. · John Keeble via Getty Images In the fourth quarter , Tesla posted revenue of $25.7bn (£19.4bn), which was well below the $27.2bn expected by analysts, as well as being up just 2% on the same period in the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.73, also came in below expectations of $0.75. For the full-year, Tesla generated revenue of $97.7bn , which was up just 1% on 2023. Story Continues For the first quarter, Britzman said that \"revenue is expected to come in broadly flat year-on-year, with a drop in earnings as Tesla transitioned to the refreshed version of its best-selling car, the Model Y. Things could pick up again in the coming quarter, with strong sales of the new Model Y to Chinese buyers a good indication that the refresh is just as popular as its predecessor.\" Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ) – Releases first quarter results on Thursday 24 April Volatility in markets on escalating trade tensions have weighed on the other Magnificent 7 stocks, including Google-parent Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), which is down 19% year-to-date. Shares fell after Alphabet reported mixed fourth quarter results in early February. Revenue of $96.47bn came in just shy of the $96.62bn expected by analysts, though earnings of $2.15 per share beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $2.13. The company also said it planned to spend $75bn on artificial intelligence (AI) this year, which was 29% higher than analysts expected, according to Reuters . Investors have become more nervous around major tech companies' level of spending on AI, on the back of Chinese startup DeepSeek releasing a lower-cost AI model, which rattled markets. Read more: The most bought stocks and funds for investors in March In a note on 8 April, JPMorgan ( JPM ) analysts said that they were \"reducing estimates, multiples, & price targets on 25 companies across our internet coverage universe based on tariff impact, macro headwinds, and a potential recession.\" They kept an \"overweight\" rating on Alphabet but lowered their price target to $180 from $220. \"As the largest global ad platform, Google is a reflection of the broader economy, and therefore we expect the company to be negatively impacted by tariff-related slowdown, macro uncertainty, and removal of the de minimis rule,\" they said. Trump signed an executive order on 2 April to close the \"de minimus\" trade loophole, which allowed merchandise priced below $800 to enter the US duty-free. JPMorgan analysts added that while Google's search business \"should be more resilient than most other types of ad spend given typically high [return on investment], it will still be affected by a weaker consumer and lower [gross domestic product], and Google also has exposure to brand spend through YouTube and Network.\" Intel ( INTC ) – Releases first quarter results on Thursday 24 April Shares in Intel ( INTC ) surged on the news of Tan's appointment in March, though the stock is still more than 5% in the red year-to-date. The company's financial struggles have made it a takeover target in recent months , with shares having risen on reports of potential deals. That included reports that TSMC ( 2330.TW , TSM ) was in talks with other chipmakers to form a joint venture to take over the company's foundry business. This division is responsible for building chips for both Intel and third-party contractors. However, a TSMC board member later denied these reports . Meanwhile, Reuters reported ahead of Tan's return that he was considering an overhaul of Intel's chip manufacturing methods and AI strategies. In a letter to employees on 12 April, Tan said: \"Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before.\" Bank of America ( BAC ) semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast last month that he thinks Intel has a \"much better shot of remaining viable in this industry\" under Tan. \"It's not going to be easy — competition is not sitting still,\" he added. \"Their competition, remember, is Nvidia ( NVDA ). It's AMD ( AMD ). It's Arm Holdings ( ARM ). It's a Taiwan Semiconductor. It is Broadcom ( AVGO ). It's Marvell ( MRVL ).\" In results released in January, Intel posted revenue of $14.3bn for the fourth quarter , which was down 7% on the same period in 2023, but beat analyst expectations of $13.8bn. Earnings per share of $0.13 were also down on the $0.54 reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, but slightly ahead of estimates of $0.12. However, guidance for the first quarter disappointed against expectations. Intel said it expected revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn in Q1, below analyst estimates of $12.85bn. Adjusted gross margins are also set to come in at 36%, below the 39% Wall Street expected. Boeing ( BA ) – Releases first quarter earnings on Wednesday 23 April Shares in Boeing ( BA ) fell earlier this week, after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that China had ordered airlines to stop taking new deliveries of its jets. The report comes as trade tensions between the US and China escalate, with a back-and-forth raising of tariffs. Last week, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many higher custom tariffs, except for those on China, which now stand at 145% — a 125% reciprocal tariff and the 20% Trump previously levied.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) highlighted the tax inequities of major corporations and billionaires, emphasizing the need for wealth tax reform. What Happened : On Tuesday, Sanders posted on X a list of several major corporations and billionaires who, according to him, paid less in federal income taxes than an individual who paid just $1. The list included Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and Nike (NYSE: NKE ), as well as billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos . Sanders pointed out that these entities paid little to no federal income taxes in various years. For instance, Tesla paid zero federal income tax on $2.3 billion of U.S. income in 2024, as per ITEP data. Don’t Miss: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Sanders’ post reflects his ongoing support for a wealth tax, suggesting a levy on the top 0.1% of earners—those with a net worth above $32 million—to generate $4.35 trillion over ten years for initiatives such as Medicare for All. Sanders’ post comes amid a growing debate on wealth inequality and tax reform. He has been vocal about his concerns regarding the growing wealth gap in the U.S. and the need for tax reforms that do not favor the ultra-wealthy. In a previous statement, Sanders emphasized that programs for working families should not be sacrificed to provide tax breaks for billionaires.

Why It Matters : The Senator’s call for tax reform also finds resonance with some of his ideological rivals. Recently, the Trump administration has reportedly been considering a tax increase for the wealthiest Americans, a move that Sanders has long advocated for. As the debate on tax reform continues, Sanders’ post serves as a stark reminder of the tax inequities that exist and the need for reform. That being said, some X users were quick to point out that with a federal income tax payment of $11 billion in 2021, Elon Musk announced himself as the highest taxpayer in history. Story Continues Moreover, Kyle Pomerleau , a senior fellow at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute, explained the phenomenon. He said that low corporate tax rates show big corporations are simply trying to minimize their tax burden, just like everyday taxpayers do. “These low effective tax rates are not reflective of tax evasion,” Pomerleau told USA Today previously. “It’s tax avoidance. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax avoidance is legal.” Read Next : How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy .

Terms were not disclosed, and both sides are finalizing a settlement agreement, the filing said. Lawyers for Pierce and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk is not a defendant. Pierce said she was subjected to pervasive harassment, including a common racial slur she said was scrawled throughout the plant including in bathrooms, and a gender-based insult. She also said she was yelled at or disciplined for conduct for which non-Black workers were excused. Pierce's complaint quotes a Tesla employee who temporarily joined her production line and said, \"Ma'am, you need to go to HR because these leads are saying things about you that are not right.\" Tesla has faced other accusations of racial discrimination and harassment at the Fremont plant. One plaintiff, elevator operator Owen Diaz, settled in March 2024 for undisclosed terms after a $3.2 million jury verdict. Another jury had awarded Diaz $137 million in 2021, but the case was retried after he rejected a lower sum the judge proposed. The case is Pierce v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-03177.

      "content": "How to play the VIX, Tesla earnings using options Josh Lipton · Host April 17, 2025 In this video: TSLA Volatility and uncertainty are the two big themes in the markets right now. That can be seen by the 40% rise in the CBOE Volatility Index ( ^VIX ) over the last month. In the video above, BayCrest Managing Director David Boole explains how to play the VIX and Tesla's ( TSLA ) upcoming earnings. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A With uncertainty remaining the word on the street volatility has entered a new phase. So how should options traders tackle the shifting rules of the volatility game? Baycrest Managing Director David Bool joins us now for the options playbook sponsored by Tastytrade. David, it's great to see you. So you say here, David, VIX 30 is the new 20. What what do you what do you mean by that, David? Walk us through it. 00:35 David Bool Well, investors have gotten very comfortable over the last year, really since COVID, that VIX kind of stays in this range in the mid-teens. And then if there's some sort of a panic, some sort of reason for risk off, it spikes above 20, sometimes gets to 30, sometimes even higher, but then the sell-off is as severe often times as the spike higher. We saw that in August of 2024. This is different. I would compare this more so to the COVID shock from a volatility perspective where you get the big move up through 30, up into fif in the 40s and then we just kind of have a new baseline. It's very similar also in that there's a lot of headline risk in the market where we're trading off of obviously Trump tweets and uh posts that he puts out. Similar to COVID where it's just any uh news article can move the market. That's almost more important than the actual economic data and earnings. We saw Netflix just now is moving just 5% after its earnings report. That's a little less than what earnings were anticipating for that move today. So but you know, a Trump tweet over the weekend could move markets much more. So when I look back at what VIX did during COVID, it stayed above 30 uh and really didn't get back below 20 until entire year from the initial spike. I think investors are just going to get used to this VIX around 30 range, which implies about a 2% move every day. Um and that's kind of what we've been seeing in April and I think that's here to stay. It's not a re it's it's a new regime that we're in. 03:06 Speaker A So as we sit in a a higher volatility environment, maybe uh structurally, at least for a little while, where are the where the opportunities that you see in the market to uh to take advantage uh through options? 03:33 David Bool So I for clients tell me the VIX is a little bit in no man's land right here. It's at 30, so it's you know, if many had a time machine, they would love to go back and buy a lot of option premium when VIX was 15, but now that options are a little bit more expensive. Um I I see clients, some of them are a little bit frozen where they're saying, wow, hedges are a little bit too expensive to buy up here with VIX above 30. Um and also many are petrified uh to to sell wall to fade it going lower. I I disagree. I think there's opportunities on both sides. If you get a little bit more clever with how you structure the trades, I think you want to play a range on either side and you can use some of that expensive volatility uh in our favor when we structure positions all while keeping it limited to the premium spent. That's very important. I'm not suggesting that you um sell a VIX 40 strike call and have the risk of blow up risk out there, but I'm seeing folks uh look to fade volatility back into the lower 20s, mid 20s, lower 20s with uh put flies on VIX. I think those are interesting and I also think there's range bound trades to still put hedges on here where you can get paid, you know, five, six, seven times your money in a very realistic range. 05:37 Speaker A David, speaking ahead, Tesla earnings on deck next week. Uh is there a trade there, David, to walk us through? 05:52 David Bool Tesla is really interesting. Speaking of trading in a range, it hasn't it's been in its own Tesla range, which is about $50 uh either maybe $60 either side of 240 where it close about where it closed today. Um the sentiment's pretty horrible in Tesla, especially where I am out here in California, and I feel like a lot of bad news may be priced into the stock and it's come down from 500 to 240. You know, I I saw an interesting call spread play a uh, you know, potential move back up to the high end of the range earlier this week. So the trade that I would put on um to benefit if the stock does go higher is the April 25th, next Friday, 265, 285 call spread. Um you're risking about $2.75. It's not much premium to be able to uh benefit from about a seven times your money payout if the stock goes back higher. That's about you get exposure to up 10, up 20% range. Um so while the stock has been lower, five of the last earnings prints, when it goes up, it really goes up. So there's been an up 20% move, an up 12% move, etc. So if you think that earnings next week are a little bit of a coin flip, I like taking that coin flip and getting paid five, six, seven times on money if that payout hits. 08:24 Speaker A David, great to see you and to have you on the show today. Thank you. 08:30 David Bool Thank you. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

TSLA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.64 per share and revenue of $104.78 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +9.09% and +7.26%, respectively. Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla.

      "content": "Tesla Whistleblower Wins Appeal Reviving Defamation Case Against Musk Faizan Farooque April 17, 2025 1 min read In this article: TSLA Cristina Balan, a former Tesla ( TSLA , Financials ) engineer, revived her long-running legal fight against the electric vehicle manufacturer and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk after winning an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with UNH. Balan, who worked at Tesla until 2014, raised concerns about a potential safety issue involving carpets curling underneath vehicle pedals, which she said could impair braking. After reporting the issue, she alleged she faced hostility from management and ultimately lost her job. She later prevailed in a wrongful dismissal case but was subsequently publicly accused by Tesla of misusing company resources for a \"secret project,\" an allegation she has denied. In 2019, Balan filed a defamation lawsuit against Tesla and Musk. The case was moved to arbitration under the terms of her employment contract, where an arbitrator dismissed her claims based on California's statute of limitations, stating too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made. Tesla sought to confirm the arbitration decision through a district court, but Balan appealed. The appeals court ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to confirm the award and ordered the case to be dismissed, allowing Balan to pursue further legal action. Balan said she plans to seek a new trial in open court, expressing confidence that she can now move forward. During the legal battle, she also fought stage-3B breast cancer and said clearing her name remains a primary motivation. Her attorney said the ruling revives her opportunity to either secure a new arbitration or obtain a public trial. Legal experts say the case could continue for some time before reaching a resolution.

      "content": "Tesla speeds up odometers to avoid warranty repairs, US lawsuit claims Jonathan Stempel April 17, 2025 2 min read In this article: TSLA By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs. The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and \"predictive algorithms\" rather than actual mileage driven. He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20. Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover. \"By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,\" the complaint said. Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office. Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show. Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city. The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges. In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action. The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.

      "content": "How Elon Musk reportedly staked Tesla’s future on robotaxis against the advice of his own senior management team Elon Musk didn’t feel a conventional compact car lived up to the Tesla brand quite like a driverless car would. · Fortune · Shawn Thew—EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images Christiaan Hetzner April 17, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA The Information reported Tesla CEO Elon Musk didn’t feel launching a compact EV was worthy of the technological disrupter and opted for the Cybercab, despite an internal report warning the latter’s sales could be so low it might not ever make money. “Ultimately, I think Elon is just uninterested in making a [Volkswagen] Golf-type car,” a source told the publication. Elon Musk is known for being among the most demanding CEOs in the world, someone who aspires to nothing less than altering the course of history whether in business or politics. So when executives on his Tesla leadership team lobbied to fill a significant gap in its product range, he was anything but impressed, according to a new report in The Information. Green-lighting a compact EV that could sell for $25,000 was the obvious and predictable move any CEO of a car company would choose, unworthy of a technological disrupter like Tesla. Musk reportedly ignored their collective counsel in favor of his preference to develop, for the same price, a fully automated robotaxi . While that has been widely speculated, the publication learned Musk had been explicitly warned the car might never be profitable, according to an analysis in an internal company report. That could mean the last holdouts still believing Tesla will launch an all-new model later this year will be disappointed. Tesla is scheduled to hold a “Company Update” on Tuesday after it publishes first-quarter results, which are expected to show an even lower automotive margin than three months ago. Sources told The Information Musk feels as if he’s achieved his underlying goal of creating a thriving EV industry, and now finds the everyday routine mundane, in their words. Launching a small car doesn’t live up to the promise of Tesla, maker of the iconoclastic Cybertruck. “Ultimately, I think Elon is just uninterested in making a [Volkswagen] Golf-type car,” one person familiar with the situation told The Information. “It just doesn’t wake him up in the morning. He was, ‘Let somebody else do it.’” Musk counting on consumers to no longer desire owning a car Musk’s senior management team suggested both models could be built, using the same platform and same assembly method to save costs. But Musk reportedly wasn’t having it, and killed off the low-cost car popularly known as the “Model 2.” The Tesla CEO had grown convinced his AI-powered Cybercab—which lacks any manual controls and only offers seating for two—would sell in the millions every year, mainly to fleets. Everyday people would eschew buying a car in favor of autonomous ride-hailing. Story Continues His analysts, however, reportedly warned the total robotaxi market in the U.S. might top out at fewer than 1 million units annually: “There is ultimately a saturation of people who want to be ferried around in somebody else’s car.” Overseas markets couldn’t be counted on either since regulators might not permit cars without a steering wheel or pedals. This left potential Cybercab sales in the hundreds of thousands. The article reveals a CEO who seemingly doesn’t base decisions on bottom-up market analyses, but rather his own innate judgment. But that gut feeling, while serving him well in the past, also led to the Cybertruck, a love-it-or-hate-it pickup whose hefty price tag and limited appeal now threaten to render it Tesla’s first bona fide bomb. Musk still waiting for Tesla’s ‘ChatGPT moment’ Tesla didn’t respond to Fortune’ s request for comment on the story. But the behavior is textbook Musk, who based his now-buried goal of selling 20 million EVs a year on nothing more than back-of-the-envelope math. His gradual shift away from cars toward robots has been closely documented by Fortune, starting in January 2022. That was the first indication that his priorities began to shift, little more than a year since first announcing plans for the Model 2. “We have too much on our plate right now, frankly,” he told investors at the time, adding his team hadn’t even begun to work on its development. Instead, he started talking up the prospects of his Optimus robot before a prototype had even been shown to investors . Musk was already convinced autonomous driving would be Tesla’s unique selling point , easily worth $50 billion in annual profits. Yet once his rival Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, won plaudits Musk felt as if he deserved, he began promising a “ ChatGPT moment ” for Tesla. All of his cars would simultaneously download from the cloud instructions on how to drive themselves, thus able to be five times as productive. It would be the single biggest one-day appreciation in asset value that history has ever recorded, he argued. Musk’s grand visions: From 20 million EVs sold a year to 100 million robots Early last year, Musk danced around the issue, claiming a $25,000 vehicle is still on track for the latter half of 2025 . Only later did it emerge he meant the Cybercab. Musk then proclaimed any company not pivoting to AI wouldn’t survive, and weeks later Tesla had officially scrapped its 20 million EV annual sales target by 2030. Musk had cooked up this impossibly large number in his head, but thanks to his image as a miracle worker it nonetheless enjoyed credibility among his fanatic investors. Instead, he fell in love with the idea that Tesla would instead one day sell 100 million Optimus droids annually—roughly the number of all new cars sold worldwide—for twice the $10,000 cost it would take to build each one. That would leave Tesla shareholders with $1 trillion in annual profits , or more than 10 times what Apple earns in a year. More important, humanity as a whole would benefit, Musk claimed, since his legions of robots would usher in an age where mankind would want for nothing. “The future we’re headed for is one where you can literally just have anything you want,” he said last month . What if people don’t want bold visions and grand promises of the future to be? What if they just wanted a small, affordable Tesla all along?

Longtime shareholder of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management , Ross Gerber criticized Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday, saying that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. What Happened : “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care,” Gerber said in an interview with Bloomberg Technology. “His next move is X AI... So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not.” Don’t Miss: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share . Gerber defended his criticism after a backlash from retail investors. “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views,” he said, adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.” Tesla’s stock has declined 33% year-to-date. Gerber links the EV maker’s stock performance to Musk’s outside activities and reduced involvement with the company. Why It Matters : Tesla continues to lead the U.S. EV market, according to data from Cox Automotive , however, sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market as a whole expanded 11.4%. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives , a long Tesla bull, echoed similar concerns, noting “Tesla investors are seeing patience wear thin” due to Musk’s absence from Tesla while focusing on his role in President Donald Trump ‘s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Despite his criticisms, Gerber maintains Tesla holdings for clients. “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products,” he said.

Johnson forecasts Tesla will deliver around 342,700 vehicles in Q2, nearly 96,000 fewer than current Wall Street estimates. He claims it's the largest gap he's seen between analyst expectations and actual delivery potential, warning the stock could face sharp downside pressure when consensus numbers reset. Tesla is rated Sell by GLJ, with a sharply bearish price target of $24.86 , a fraction of its current trading level near $242. Johnson pointed to shrinking delivery volumes, mounting global EV competition, and waning customer loyalty as mounting concerns. He also flagged CEO Elon Musk's controversial political presence as a growing risk. In February, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro cited Musk's outspoken views and trimmed his price target on Tesla to $474 from $492, noting falling consumer favorability.

The plaintiff alleges the company inflates the readings on the distance-measuring odometers in its vehicles to reduce warranty periods and steer people to purchase extended warranties. Tesla is facing a proposed class-action suit from owners who allege the auto manufacturer has illegally manipulated odometer readings to reduce warranty periods and save the company from having to pay for repairs to the vehicles. A California Tesla owner, who is seeking class-action status, says he bought a used Tesla in December 2022 that had 36,772 miles on the odometer. Soon after, he needed some repairs done, which was when he noticed \"peculiar patterns\" in his mileage totals. \" Tesla Inc. knowingly overstates the distances traveled in Tesla Vehicles, or at minimum tolerates substantial inaccuracy in distances traveled in Tesla Inc.’s favor, such that the 'odometers' in Tesla Vehicles indicate greater distances than what they actually travel,\" the suit alleges. Lead plaintiff Nyree Hinton says he noticed his vehicle was logging 72 miles per day, when he only traveled 20 miles to and from work. That surge put the vehicle past the 50,000-mile warranty limit, voiding the Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty, which covers repair costs. The lawsuit claims that instead of measuring physical distance, Tesla odometers estimate mileage based on energy consumption and driver behavior, which inflates the numbers, so Tesla both saves money on repairs and raises revenue from other sources. \"By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,\" the suit alleges. \"Tesla has thus misled, induced, and defrauded consumers from obtaining the benefits of Tesla Inc.’s warranties.\" Tesla did not reply to Fortune 's request for comment about the suit.

Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener. RESTRICTIONS: In a regulatory filing, Nvidia ( NVDA) stated, “On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed NVIDIA Corporation, or the company, that the USG requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of the Company’s H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. The USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China. On April 14, 2025, the USG informed the company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future. The company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27, 2025. First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” Wells Fargo notes that following Nvidia’s 8K announcement last night, AMD (AMD) has filed an 8K this morning announcing that it too expects new U.S. Government license controls on GPU sales into China to impact the company’s MI308X. AMD says that while it expects to apply for licenses, there are no assurances that licenses will be granted. Therefore, the company is announcing that it expects to take up to an $800M inventory, purchase commitment, and related reserve charge, likely in Q2, says Wells. The firm has an Overweight rating on AMD with a price target of $140. PARTS FROM CHINA: Tesla’s ( TSLA) plans to ship parts from China for the Cybercab and Semi electric trucks in the U.S. were suspended after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods, Reuters reports , citing a person with direct knowledge. The move may disrupt the company’s plans to begin mass production of the models. Tesla was prepared to absorb the costs when Trump imposed the 34% tariff on Chinese goods but could not do so when the tariffs were increased, leaving shipping plans suspended, the person told Reuters. DELISTING: Officials in President Donald Trump’s administration and the president’s supporters are “leaning further into the prospect of delisting the nearly 300 Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges,” according to a recap from Politico . On April 10, Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino previously reported, citing sources, that the Trump administration was proceeding toward a possible delisting of Chinese public company shares on U.S. exchanges. Chinese companies that publicly trade in the U.S. include Alibaba ( BABA), Yum China ( YUMC), Tencent ( TCEHY), NetEase ( NTES), PDD (PDD) , Nio (NIO) , Baidu ( BIDU), and JD .com (JD) . Story continues EARTH MINERALS EXPORTS: China has suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets as part of China’s retaliation for President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs that started on April 2, the New York Times’ Keith Bradsher reported . On April 4, the Chinese government ordered restrictions on the export of six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90% of which are produced in China, the report noted. Publicly traded companies in the space include MP (MP) . FARMERS: In a post to Truth Social, President Donald Trump stated , “Our farmers are GREAT, but because of their GREATNESS, they are always put on the Front Line with our adversaries, such as China, whenever there is a Trade negotiation or, in this case, a Trade War. The same thing happened in my First Term. China was brutal to our Farmers, I these Patriots to just hold on, and a great trade deal was made. I rewarded our farmers with a payment of $28 Billion Dollars, all through the China deal. It was a great transaction for the USA, until Crooked Joe Biden came in and didn’t enforce it. China largely reneged on the deal (although they behaved during the Trump Administration), only buying a portion of what they agreed to buy. They had ZERO respect for the Crooked Biden Administration, and who can blame them for that? Interestingly, they just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‘not take possession’ of fully committed to aircraft. The USA will PROTECT OUR FARMERS!!!” Publicly traded companies in agriculture space include Andersons ( ANDE), Archer Daniels ( ADM), Bunge ( BG), CF Industries (CF) , Compass Minerals ( CMP), Intrepid Potash ( IPI) and Mosaic ( MOS). LITTLE PROGRESS WITH EU: Officials from the European Union and U.S. made little progress bridging trade differences this week and officials from President Donald Trump’s administration indicated that the bulk of the U.S. tariffs imposed on the bloc will not be removed, sources told Bloomberg’s Alberto Nardelli and Jorge Valero. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic left the meeting with little clarity on the U.S. stance and is struggling to determine the American side’s aims after having met for about two hours with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, people familiar with the discussions are reported to have said.

      "title": "Earnings Preview: Harley-Davidson (HOG) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline",
      "content": "Earnings Preview: Harley-Davidson (HOG) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline Zacks Equity Research April 17, 2025 5 min read In this article: HOG TSLA Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Harley-Davidson (HOG) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This motorcycle maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.7%. Revenues are expected to be $1.12 billion, down 24.3% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Harley-Davidson? For Harley-Davidson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +20.82%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Harley-Davidson will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Harley-Davidson would post a loss of $0.68 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.93, delivering a surprise of -36.76%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Harley-Davidson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Another stock from the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, Tesla (TSLA), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $21.5 billion, up 1% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Tesla has been revised 19.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.79%. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

      "title": "Is Tesla the Ultimate Long-Term Winner?",
      "content": "Is Tesla the Ultimate Long-Term Winner? Nabeel Bukhari April 17, 2025 12 min read In this article: TSLA Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA , Financial ) is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla's bets big for 2025 Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Is Tesla the Ultimate Long-Term Winner? Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Story Continues Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft ( LYFT , Financial ) and Uber ( UBER , Financial ), which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025 . Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Is Tesla the Ultimate Long-Term Winner? Source: Tesla Optimus (Company's Website) Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth . Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. Q4 Financial Performance & Outlook The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for "

      "content": "Is TSLA a Buy Pre-Q1 Earnings? Investors Want These Answers First Rimmi Singhi April 17, 2025 6 min read In this article: TSLA F Electric vehicle (EV) and tech titan Tesla TSLA is slated to release first-quarter 2025 results on April 22, after market close. While Wall Street will focus on whether its earnings meet expectations, many investors are just as eager for CEO Elon Musk’s answers to burning strategic questions. From progress on Full Self-Driving (FSD) updates and affordable EVs to updates on the Optimus robot and AI initiatives, the earnings call could provide much-needed clarity at a time when Tesla’s stock is under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 45 cents per share and $21.85 billion, respectively. The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised downward by 8 cents over the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection indicates no change from the year-ago quarter’s levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 2.6%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA’s revenues is pegged at $104.8 billion, implying a rise of 7.3% year over year. The consensus mark for 2025 EPS is pegged at $2.64, implying growth of around 9% on a year-over-year basis. In the trailing four quarters, Tesla missed EPS estimates thrice and beat once, with the average earnings surprise being 0.8%. Tesla, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tesla, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tesla, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tesla, Inc. Quote Q1 Earnings Whispers for Tesla Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. TSLA has an Earnings ESP of -11.69% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) Factors Shaping TSLA’s Q1 Results In the first quarter, Tesla produced 362,615 (345,454 Model 3/Y and 17,161 other models) vehicles. It delivered 336,681 vehicles (323,800 Model 3/Y and 12,881 other models) globally. The deliveries not just missed our expectations of 409,584 units, they were down 32% and 13% on a sequential and yearly basis, respectively. In fact, the first-quarter 2025 deliveries marked the weakest numbers in more than two years. Low sales volume, along with generous discounts on its offerings amid a stiff price war, is expected to have weighed on automotive revenues and gross margins. However, Tesla has been making progress in reducing its cost of goods sold, which might have somewhat offset the pressure. We expect first-quarter gross margins from automotive sales to fall from 17.8% in the year-ago quarter to 15.8%. Story Continues On the positive side, Tesla's energy generation and storage business has been gaining traction. In the first quarter of 2025, the company deployed 10.4 GWh of energy storage products, up a massive 156% year over year. With strong demand for its Megapack and Powerwall products, revenues from this segment are estimated at $3.1 billion, implying a 90% increase year over year. Gross profit is expected to more than double. Tesla's Services/Other unit is forecast to generate $3 billion in revenues — up 32% year over year — driven primarily by its expanding supercharging network. Major auto biggies like General Motors GM and Ford F are using Tesla's NACS charging standard, boosting the segment’s outlook. Tesla Price Performance & Valuation Year to date, shares of Tesla have plunged roughly 40%, underperforming the industry, sector and S&P 500. The price performance also compares unfavorably with General Motors and Ford, which have lost 17% and 5%, respectively, in the same timeframe. YTD Price Performance Comparison Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation perspective, Tesla appears quite pricey. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 7.04, higher than the industry’s 2.18. Tesla is also significantly overvalued relative to General Motors (P/S ratio of 0.25) and Ford (P/S ratio of 0.23). Tesla’s Valuation Not Attractive Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Musk’s growing political involvement has dented brand appeal, with sales slowing in the United States, Europe and China. Disgruntled owners and increasing backlash have raised investor concerns. Big Questions That TSLA Investors Want Musk to Answer As Tesla gears up for its first-quarter earnings call, investors are eager for clarity on several hot topics. Will the company provide an update on the long-awaited unsupervised FSD and the much-hyped Cybercab? Is Tesla on track to launch its affordable models? With global tensions and tariffs on the rise, how is the company preparing to stay agile? There’s also growing curiosity around the Optimus robot as Musk previously said it could generate over $10 trillion in revenues. Does he still believe that? And has Tesla made any moves to license FSD to rivals? Investors are all ears. How Should You Play TSLA Pre-Q1 Earnings? First things first. Tesla’s core EV business is under pressure from competition and sluggish demand. The brand’s shine isn’t what it used to be. Musk’s high-profile role in the Department of Government Efficiency has become a growing concern, fueling worries about his divided attention, especially at a time when Tesla is struggling with low sales and competition challenges. Tesla’s long-term pitch now leans heavily on its autonomous driving ambition. For Tesla, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. It must prove that its AV technology works with no further delays. Progress in FSD approvals and robotaxi development will be critical. The company plans to roll out unsupervised FSD in Austin this June. Last month, it secured the first of several approvals required to eventually launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in California. Still, given recent delivery disappointments, valuation concerns and the potential for further near-term weakness, it may be wise for investors to wait for clarity from the first-quarter 2025 call before taking action. If results underwhelm—and Musk’s commentary doesn’t restore confidence—the stock could face more downside. Conservative investors may consider staying on the sidelines or even reducing exposure.

      "content": "Ford Warns of Price Hikes as Trump Tariff Uncertainty Lingers Zacks Equity Research April 17, 2025 4 min read In this article: F TSLA Ford Motor Company F is preparing to increase prices on vehicles starting with those produced in May 2025 if President Donald Trump doesn't follow through on the tariff relief he's suggested for automakers. Per a memo sent to dealers by Andrew Frick, president of Ford’s gas-powered and electric car divisions, the company anticipates it will need to adjust vehicle pricing unless there’s a significant shift in Trump’s tariff stance. These pricing changes would apply to vehicles built in May, which won’t reach U.S. dealerships until late June or early July, after Ford’s current employee-pricing-for-everyone promotion ends. The prices of vehicles already in inventory will remain unchanged. This warning marks the clearest indication yet that automakers may pass on some of the increased costs tied to Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. It comes just two days after Trump mentioned that he was considering a temporary break from the tariffs to allow carmakers more time to shift production back to the United States. Trump is also expected to impose similar duties on certain imported car parts by May 3. While Ford is still working to understand the full scope of Trump’s trade policies, it expects some tariffs will stay in place for the foreseeable future. Detroit automakers have been actively lobbying the White House for exemptions on parts they argue are critical and would otherwise cause serious financial strain. Although Ford manufactures 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States at domestic plants, it builds most budget-friendly models, the electric Mustang Mach-E, the Maverick small pickup and the Bronco Sport SUV in Mexico. High Tariff to Further Strain F’s Shrinking Sales & Profits Ford has already been struggling with stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024. Discouragingly, the company expects segmental loss in the range of $5-$5.5 billion in 2025. The automaker’s full-year adjusted EBIT is forecasted between $7 billion and $8.5 billion, down from $10.2 billion in 2024. Notably, Ford’s weak guidance doesn’t even take into account any changes in policies from the Trump administration. These tariffs are expected to increase raw material costs and finally translate to a high cost of vehicles, thereby derailing demand and affecting the sales and profits of Ford. Other Automakers to Get Impacted by High Tariffs High tariffs could impact General Motors Company ’s GM results as the company imported roughly 750,000 vehicles from Canada/Mexico in 2024. The higher tariffs would not only affect fully assembled vehicles but also the cost of parts sourced from Mexico, further escalating production costs for GM’s U.S.-based plants. Tariffs on steel and aluminum could raise Tesla, Inc. ’s TSLA vehicle costs, hurting affordability or squeezing margins. If tariffs on Mexico and Canada are enacted, supply chain disruptions could add further pressure. With these tariffs, the cost of vehicles is expected to rise, and affordability issues could weigh on demand. If Tesla absorbs additional costs, it will further strain its already squeezing margins. Either way, these tariffs will put pressure on Tesla.

With Q4 behind us, let’s have a look at Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and its peers. Much capital investment and technical know-how are needed to manufacture functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing automobiles for the mass market. Barriers to entry are therefore high, and auto manufacturers with economies of scale can boast strong economic moats. However, this doesn’t insulate them from new entrants, as electric vehicles (EVs) have entered the market and are upending it. This has forced established manufacturers to not only contend with emerging EV-first competitors but also decide how much they want to invest in these disruptive technologies, which will likely cannibalize their legacy offerings. The 7 automobile manufacturing stocks we track reported a strong Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 6.1%. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 18.4% since the latest earnings results.

Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates. Rivian Total Revenue Rivian achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions).

Market Update Thanks to the Fed’s series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

      "title": "At What Price Would Tesla Stock Be Worth Buying?",
      "content": "At What Price Would Tesla Stock Be Worth Buying? By Daniel Sparks – Apr 17, 2025 at 4:51AM Key Points Even with the stock losing more than a third of its value this year, Tesla still commands a market capitalization that prices in extraordinary future growth. The company will need more than a strong automotive business to live up to its valuation. CEO Elon Musk thinks the company could be the most valuable in the world one day. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.36 %) $ 15.10 Current Price $ 433.88 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET The electric car maker's shares have fallen sharply this year. But have they declined enough to make the stock a buy? With electric car maker Tesla ( TSLA 3.36% ) going from growing its vehicle deliveries at rates of around 50% annually as recently as 2022, to about flat sales growth in 2024 and declining sales to start the year in 2025, many investors are likely still trying to figure out how to value the automaker. Making it more difficult, Tesla management says the company is in between two major growth waves, yet there's no clear catalyst guaranteeing strong growth anytime soon. In an effort to value Tesla shares and see if the growth stock is worth buying today, let's consider some of the information we have about the company. I'll carefully try to piece together a picture of the company's prospects relative to the stock's current valuation. Spoiler alert: I don't think shares are a buy at their current price. But there is a price I would consider buying into this growth story. Read on to see what that price is. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.36 %) $ -15.10 Current Price $ 433.88 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.19 - $ 451.67 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 4.1M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A Bull case vs. bear case The bull case for Tesla boils down to what's in the pipeline. Reading through a transcript of the automaker's most recent earnings call is a great place to start to understand just how optimistic the company's aspirations for future growth are. \"I see a path of Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far,\" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in late January. To be fair, he also emphasized that it wouldn't be \"an easy path.\" Still, this is quite the statement considering that Tesla's market capitalization currently stands at not far above $800 billion. This is a far cry from some of the biggest companies in the U.S., with market caps around $3 trillion. How does Tesla get to the top? With the help of the company's expertise in manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, according to Musk. Specifically, the CEO believes that yet-to-be launched lower-cost vehicles, the planned rollout of an autonomous taxi service this summer, future sales of humanoid robots, and continued rapid growth of the company's energy storage business will play key roles in Tesla's future growth. But all of this starkly contrasts with the company's current business trajectory. Not only did Tesla's first-quarter deliveries fall 13% year over year and 32% sequentially, but production was about 7% higher than deliveries. While we can't know for sure whether Tesla's supply and demand are appropriately balanced, these numbers certainly don't look promising. But even though Tesla's recent results may appear disastrous on the surface, investors should consider a few things. A higher interest rate environment has been a burden on auto sales overall; as lower sales volumes in this more difficult consumer environment fade into the rearview mirror, Tesla will have easier comparisons, and sales growth could improve. Further, investors should note that one reason for softer sales during the first quarter of 2025 was Tesla's decision to update its factories during the period -- a move that management said would ultimately lead to several weeks of lost production. Is Tesla stock a buy? While it's tempting to jump on board with the Tesla bulls in hopeful excitement about the company's future, a better approach is probably one that balances skepticism and optimism. Trading at about 124 times earnings as of this writing, the market seems dead-set on a spectacularly positive outcome for the company in the coming years. A valuation like this prices in more than robust growth, it prices in outstanding growth. At Tesla stock's current valuation, the market is anticipating a return to sustained double-digit sales growth and significant profit margin expansion in the years ahead. I'm OK with betting on a turnaround and a return to robust growth rates. I think Tesla has proven itself enough for investors to get on board with this idea. But pricing in an extraordinary future that transcends anything ever done in the automotive industry, as well as the promise of Tesla stretching into substantial high-margin revenue streams in the tech sector, is something that should be viewed with at least some skepticism. So, would I buy Tesla shares today? No. But if they fell to around $200 -- about a 25% drop -- I might change my mind. At $200, I'd still be taking a leap of faith. But that leap would leave some room for a scenario in which not all of the company's plans go according to plan.

      "content": "Finally, a Little Good News for Tesla Investors By Daniel Miller – Apr 17, 2025 at 4:05AM Key Points Tesla's Cybertruck has largely been a disappointment. Its base trim will now be available to consumers at roughly $72,000. In addition, lower-priced Model 3 and Model Y could be on the way. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.36 %) $ 15.10 Current Price $ 433.88 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET After years of being a high-flying stock with strong sales growth, it could be argued this is the worst investors have felt about Tesla ( TSLA 3.36% ) ever. While the EV maker still dominates the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market in overall volume and market share, it also posted its first-ever global sales decline in 2024. On the bright side, there was a little good news for investors recently regarding the controversial Cybertruck. Officially a flop? It's been a rough go for the company's newest vehicle, especially considering CEO Elon Musk previously noted the automaker expected to produce between 250,000 and 500,000 Cybertrucks per year, which would challenge even traditional gasoline-powered trucks. And while the Cybertruck has fallen far, far short of those expectations, there was a bit of good news regarding the controversial truck when it announced the base trim would now be available for just over $72,000. Currently, the three-motor Cyberbeast trim is at the top when it comes to pricing, starting at nearly $106,000 with shipping and order fee. It's roughly a $10,000 drop in price compared to the current all-wheel drive trim, and a little closer to the $60,990 Tesla said it would cost before shipping. Remember, originally when the Cybertruck was presented in 2019, it came with a promised price tag of just under $40,000. The new lower-cost version will strip out features such as all-wheel drive, the rear light bar, and air suspension, among other smaller changes. Further, removing the front motor from the all-wheel drive version will put its range up to 350 miles compared to the current version at 325 miles -- and it charges a bit faster, too. The increased range, charge speed, and lower price could help spur sales activity for a model that has drastically disappointed investors and consumers alike. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.36 %) $ -15.10 Current Price $ 433.88 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.19 - $ 451.67 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 4.1M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A What would success look like? It's pretty clear investors can knock the previous expectations down a notch, or two, but what would success look like if the lower-price Cybertruck gains some traction? One would have to start by looking at rival Ford Motor Company and its F-150 Lightning. During the first quarter, Ford sold 7,187 F-150 Lightnings, compared to an estimated 6,406 Cybertrucks, per Cox Automotive. While the gap between the two seems narrow, the Cybertruck would really need to double its sales consistently to be considered a success -- and that's still a long way away from original expectations. What could be of interest to investors is that this could be the first step in the company's larger lower-price strategy. According to analysts, Tesla is rumored to be working on more stripped-down versions of the popular Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers for 2025. The lower-priced models will have their work cut out to reverse recent brand damage. \"This is our first look at the impact of recent brand damage -- and it appears to be the primary driver behind this quarter's delivery decline,\" Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, according to Reuters. \"These growth rates will likely deteriorate further this quarter.\" Munster went on to predict a 9% decline in deliveries for 2025, with an aging lineup, recent political backlash, and increasing competition driving the decline. All that said, Tesla will have its chance to repair its brand damage, even if not overnight, and lower-priced vehicles could provide a small jolt to the company's deliveries. 2025 might set up to be another disappointing year for the automaker, but if it can freshen its lineup, repair brand damage, and follow through on its many ambitions, brighter days should remain ahead.

Following her resignation from the company, she filed a defamation lawsuit alleging that Tesla publicly accused her of embezzlement for allegedly using company resources for a personal project. Arbitration decision reversed Initially, a judge upheld an arbitration decision that dismissed Balans' case because of the California statute of limitations. However, a panel of appellate judges in California overturned that ruling, ruling that the district court lacked jurisdiction to affirm the arbitration award. This decision clears the way for Balan to potentially take her libel claim against Tesla and Elon Musk to court.

      "title": "Why Elon Musk installed his top lieutenants at a federal agency you probably haven't heard of",
      "content": "Why Elon Musk installed his top lieutenants at a federal agency you probably haven't heard of Published: 2025-04-17 00:02:05 ET TSLA WASHINGTON (AP) — On the rooftop patio of the General Services Administration headquarters, an agency staffer recently discovered something strange: a rectangular device attached to a wire that snaked across the roof, over the ledge and into the administrator’s window one floor below. It didn’t take long for the employee — an IT specialist — to figure out the device was a transceiver that communicates with Elon Musk’s vast and private Starlink satellite network. Concerned that the equipment violated federal laws designed to protect public data, staffers reported the discovery to superiors and the agency’s internal watchdog. The Starlink equipment raises a host of questions about what Musk and his efficiency czars are doing at GSA, an obscure agency that is playing an outsized role in the Trump administration’s quest to slash costs and bring the federal government to heel. Among other clues that GSA is a critical cog in Musk's stated efforts to slash billions of dollars in federal spending: people with ties to the entrepreneur or his companies hold key jobs at the agency. Its acting administrator is a Silicon Valley tech executive with expertise in rolling out artificial intelligence tools and a wife who once worked for Musk at his social media company, X. An engineer at Tesla, the billionaire’s electric car company, runs the GSA’s technology division. And one of Musk’s trusted lieutenants is helping to spearhead the work of downsizing the government’s real estate footprint. GSA oversees many of Uncle Sam’s real estate transactions, collecting and paying rent on behalf of almost every federal agency. It helps manage billions in federal contracts. And it assists other agencies in building better websites and digital tools for citizens. It is so important because it is “a choke point for all agencies,” said Steven Schooner, a George Washington University law school professor who specializes in government contracting. “They can, in effect, stop all civilian agencies from purchasing, period. That’s everything.” In a statement in early March, GSA said it planned to get rid of “non-core assets” and welcomed “creative solutions, including sale-lease backs, ground leases and other forms of public/private partnerships.” The search for those cuts has engulfed the entire 12,000-person agency. At the helm of that push is the GSA’s acting administrator, Stephen Ehikian, the tech executive whose wife worked for X. “GSA was built for this moment,” Ehikian told employees last month in a meeting, a video of which was viewed by The Associated Press. “This agency is the backbone of federal government operations,” said Ehikian, who is seeking to expand automation — through the use of artificial intelligence — of many GSA functions. “We literally have an impact on the administration’s mandate right now, which is around efficiency.” Another close Musk adviser — Nicole Hollander — is driving the initiative to unload the government’s real estate. Her husband, Steve Davis, is acting as the de facto leader of the Musk-inspired Department of Government Efficiency. Hollander, who studied business and real estate at George Washington University, is a licensed property manager in Washington, according to LinkedIn. Her profile also lists her as an employee of X since 2023. In early March, the GSA real estate division released a list of hundreds of government-owned or leased properties it sought to sell in a frenzied rush. The list drew sharp criticism from Democrats and civil society groups because it proposed the sale of the Justice Department headquarters and included at least one undisclosed Central Intelligence Agency facility. GSA quickly withdrew the list. That did not stall DOGE's fire sale. In the presentation viewed by the AP, Ehikian said the agency has canceled more than 680 leases, listed or sold at least 32 properties worth $185 million and cut more than $50 billion in contracts. Hollander has mostly operated behind the scenes. She rarely appears in Zoom meetings, according to employees. Documents obtained by the AP show spreadsheets she creates are stripped of her name and replaced with a more generic “GSA leadership.” The AP also obtained copies of some event invitations on Hollander’s calendar. They showed Hollander had several meetings with commercial real estate and services firms, including a brokerage firm and a real estate consulting company that helps companies economize their space. She also took meetings with a consortium of Washington technology companies. Hollander did not respond to a request for comment sent over LinkedIn or through a GSA spokesperson. It’s not the first time that Hollander has led a cost-cutting campaign for Musk. A lawsuit brought by fired Twitter employees in 2023 alleged that Hollander and Davis were part of a “cadre of sycophants” who were particularly zealous in implementing Musk’s mandate overhaul of the social media company. The suit claimed the pair, following their boss’ orders, circumvented San Francisco building and safety codes, ignored their obligation to pay vendors and landlords and downsized without regard to the turmoil it caused employees or customers. The couple, the lawsuit alleged, also lived at Twitter headquarters with their month-old child, mirroring Musk, who has a reputation for living at his company offices. That pattern appears to be repeating at GSA: Hollander has installed cots on the agency’s sixth floor, according to employees. Attorneys for Musk and X have moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the Delaware federal court lacks jurisdiction and the lawsuit is legally groundless. Another employee installed by the Trump administration at GSA worked for Musk at Tesla. Shortly after taking over GSA’s technology unit, Thomas Shedd told his workforce the goal was to “move fast and make changes,” according to a transcript of the February meeting obtained by the AP. That's a variation on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s motto of moving fast and breaking things. Shedd soon began demanding access to sensitive systems that enable the public to communicate or interact with government services, according to staffers who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisal. Shedd’s request prompted pushback from existing GSA staff. One employee resigned rather than give Shedd access, according to 404 Media. He also told staff he wanted to consolidate all the government contracts in a centralized database to more easily figure out which ones to eliminate, according to a transcript of the meeting. It’s not clear if he accomplished that goal. Shedd did not reply to emails seeking comment. He and other GSA officials have also sought to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence. In March, employees were given a demo of a new internal AI chatbot that is designed to more speedily identify contracts and real estate that can be jettisoned. Government agencies like GSA have been hesitant to deploy AI in such ways due to data-security and privacy concerns, according to current and former officials. It’s not known what role — if any — Starlink is playing in GSA’s technological evolution. On the GSA roof, employees found at least two transceivers, including the one with a wire running to the administrator’s office. It is not clear why the agency is using Starlink. The network provides internet service but is not generally approved for use in most government computer systems. IT staffers, who reported the discovery to superiors, were concerned that the devices were not authorized to be used at GSA and DOGE might be utilizing them to siphon off agency data, according to internal emails obtained by the AP and a GSA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. GSA’s IT staff opened an investigation to see if the terminals were a security threat, and an"

The drop comes despite an 8% increase in total new car registrations across the state during the same period. Tesla's share of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) market in California fell to 43.9%, slipping below the 50% threshold for the first time. A year ago, the automaker commanded over 55% of the ZEV segment. The California New Car Dealers Association attributed the ongoing decline in part to Tesla's direct-to-consumer sales approach and CEO Elon Musk's polarizing public profile. The association also warned that mandates alone won't sustain EV growth if customer demand fades. Overall, ZEVs now account for 20.8% of all new car sales in California, down from 22% a year earlier. Tesla still held the third spot in the state's overall vehicle market with a 9.1% share, trailing Toyota ( NYSE:TM ) at 16.5% and Honda ( NYSE:HMC ) at 10.8%.

According to Experian Automotive, Tesla's car registrations in the state fell 15.1% year-over-year in Q1 marking the sixth consecutive quarterly decline. This trend stands in contrast to the broader auto market in California, which saw total new vehicle registrations rise 8.3% during the same period. The California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA) pointed to Tesla's direct-to-consumer sales model and CEO Elon Musk's public image as possible factors contributing to the brand's decline in appeal. Tesla's share of the state's Zero Emission Vehicle market slipped to 43.9%, down 11.6% from the prior year. ZEVs now make up 20.8% of total car sales in the state, down from 22% a year ago signaling broader headwinds for the segment.

The EV maker had aimed to kick off trial production of both vehicles later this year, with full-scale manufacturing expected in 2026. But the rising costs from tariff hikesjumping from 34% to 84% on April 9 and now at 125%have forced Tesla to shelve shipments, a source told Reuters. The delay puts a dent in two major launches for Tesla. The Cybercab, a steering-wheel-free robotaxi, was expected to cost under $30,000. The Semi was being prepped for large commercial deliveries, including to PepsiCo ( PEP , Financials ). Tesla had been shifting toward more North American sourcing, anticipating trade tensions. Still, key components for both vehicles were coming from China. Reuters also reported that Tesla has stopped taking new orders for its Model S and Model X in China after Beijing responded with its own 125% tariff on U.S. goods. Trump, meanwhile, has hinted at revisiting other auto-related tariffs and said automakers will need time to make 'em here, Reuters reported.

These robust figures may have bolstered investor confidence, contributing to a 15% gain in the company's share price over the past week. Despite the broader market downturn prompted by U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China affecting major tech stocks, Tesla managed to outperform the trend. This suggests the company's strong operational results provided a counterweight to the negative market environment experienced by other tech firms. We've identified 3 possible red flags for Tesla that you should be aware of. NasdaqGS:TSLA Earnings Per Share Growth as at Apr 2025 Explore 22 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research. The recent production and delivery figures reported by Tesla, alongside its significant share price gain, suggest that the company's operational success is resonating with investors and could potentially influence its revenue and earnings forecasts. With a solid foundation in Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities, AI, and other technological advancements, Tesla's strategic initiatives may further enhance its growth potential, driving increased revenue and improved margins. These developments could also affect the consensus price target of US$313.96, potentially altering market expectations. Over the past five years, Tesla's total shareholder return was very large, which highlights its long-term appeal. Comparatively, Tesla also achieved remarkable performance over the past year, significantly exceeding the US Auto industry's return of 44.9%. This performance, in connection with its current initiatives, continues to distinguish Tesla as a key player in the electric vehicle and technology sectors. While the price target suggests a potential upside from the current share price of US$221.86 to US$318.27, the impact of Tesla's recent performance could influence future valuation assessments. Investors should consider how the company's expansion in AI, FSD, and robotics may further shape revenue growth, while the aggressive manufacturing changes present risks to both margins and earnings forecasts. In light of our recent valuation report, it seems possible that Tesla is trading beyond its estimated value. This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

      "content": "Elon Musk Said He Had to Borrow Money From Friends To Pay $170K A Month In Legal Fees During First Divorce — But Adds: 'I Never Said I Was Broke' Jeannine Mancini April 16, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA Before he became the world's richest man , Elon Musk was publicly defending himself against headlines about his personal life — and fighting a legal bill that would make most billionaires wince. In 2010, Musk published a personal essay in Business Insider responding to what he called \"inaccuracies\" surrounding his divorce from author Justine Musk . The piece was blunt, sharply structured, and divided by biting section headings like \"Dangerous Clichés,\" \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" and \"How Many Lawyers Does it Take to Screw in a...?\" Don't Miss: Inspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share! The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ? One of the most widely repeated claims at the time was that Musk had gone broke. Musk was quick to set the record straight: \"I never said in any court documents that I was ‘broke' or even that I lacked considerable assets.\" What he explained instead was a cash flow crisis . \"Rather than allow Tesla to die,\" he wrote, \"I committed almost all my cash reserves to the company, leaving a few million dollars to cover living expenses.\" That may sound like plenty — but not when you're paying two sets of divorce lawyers under California law. \"What caught me by surprise, and forced me to seek emergency loans from friends,\" Musk wrote, \"were the enormous legal fees I had to pay my ex-wife's divorce lawyers.\" According to him, those bills added up to $4 million, or roughly $170,000 per month for two years. Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation. At the time, Musk was running both Tesla and SpaceX , raising five young sons, and finalizing his divorce — all while preparing to marry actress Talulah Riley , whom he'd later divorce twice . He said he owned \"no homes (not even my residence at this point), yachts or expensive artwork,\" and dressed mostly in jeans and T-shirts. As for the settlement? According to Musk, the marital agreement entitled Justine to around $20 million after tax. But before the trial, he said he offered her more than double — roughly the pre-tax equivalent of $80 million — and even offered to make charitable donations in her name. \"Justine said no to this offer,\" he wrote, \"and continued to insist on receiving ownership in Tesla and SpaceX.\" Story Continues On May 3, 2010, a California judge ruled the marital agreement was valid and enforceable. Musk's motion for non-suit was granted within hours. Even assuming all of Justine's claims were true, the judge said, she would still lose. Musk's final line in the essay? \"Justine has decided to appeal...\" \"In the 21st century,\" he wrote, \"privacy just doesn't exist.\" But back then, he made sure his side of the story did .

      "content": "Tesla Accused of Fudging Odometers to Avoid Warranty Repairs IEN · Tesla Ben Munson April 16, 2025 2 min read In this article: TSLA As if it didn’t already have enough going on with declining sales and concerning recalls, Tesla has found itself in more trouble after the electric automaker was targeted in a new class-action lawsuit. According to The Street , Tesla has been accused of deliberately fudging the mileage on its vehicles’ odometers in an apparent attempt to avoid paying for repairs that would normally be covered under warranty. Most Read on IEN: The $25,000 Electric Truck Whirlpool Layoffs Rock Iowa PODCAST: Whirlpool's Layoffs; Torpedo Bat Demand Skyrockets; TI Cuts Jobs Illinois Plant Destroyed by Fire The plaintiff in the lawsuit said he bought a used 2020 Model Y Tesla vehicle with 36,772 miles on it. He said he started to notice \"peculiar patterns” in mileage while the vehicle was continually having problems with its suspension. He claimed his daily driving habits should have amounted to about 20 miles per day, but his Tesla’s odometer was registering an average of 72 miles per day. As a result, he said Basic Warranty expired way ahead of schedule. The lawsuit claims that Tesla’s odometer system relies on “predictive algorithms, energy consumption metrics and driver behavior multipliers that manipulate and misrepresent the actual mileage travelled by Tesla vehicles.” And by doing so, the automaker is accelerating the rate of depreciation and the expiration of warranties for its vehicles. “By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated ‘odometer’ readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,” the lawsuit reads. As the report points out, other owners have accused Tesla of the same type of mileage manipulation. The lawsuit is another headache for Tesla as it deals with several other problems. Earlier this month, the company reported a double-digit drop in sales for the first quarter of 2025, which the Associated Press attributed to an aging lineup, increasing competition and backlash from CEO Elon Musk’s political career. Tesla is also facing another high-profile recall for its high-profile Cybertruck, this time because pieces of the electric truck are flying off while driving.

      "content": "BNP Paribas cuts Tesla target, warns Q1 may force rethink on earnings outlook Pratyush Thakur April 16, 2025 1 min read In this article: TSLA Investing.com -- BNP Paribas said that Tesla’s first-quarter results could lead investors to sharply lower their expectations for the company, as demand softens and profitability comes under pressure. The brokerage cut its 2026 earnings estimate by 38% and lowered its price target to $137 from $150, maintaining an “underperform” rating. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries fell 13% year-over-year in the first quarter, which BNP said could drive the company’s core automotive margins to record lows. Rising costs from tariffs, declining sales of emissions credits, and the potential loss of U.S. tax subsidies for electric vehicles are likely to weigh further on earnings, analysts at BNP added. One of the biggest risks, according to BNP, is Tesla’s exposure to China, which accounts for nearly 40% of sales. The firm warned that growing U.S.-China tensions could lead to a consumer backlash against American brands, similar to what happened with Japanese and Korean carmakers in past disputes. BNP also questioned Tesla’s ability to fund its long-term ambitions, particularly its plans for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. The firm now expects the company to post negative free cash flow in 2025 and 2026, even before accounting for the estimated $30–40 billion needed to build a robotaxi network. \"With FCF set to turn negative, investors may increasingly ask how Tesla can fund its AI plans,\" analyst said. “Being a serious AI player requires serious capital,” the analysts added, saying that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may need to raise $20 billion or more in fresh equity to move forward. BNP said Wall Street’s estimates have not yet reflected Tesla’s new challenges and sees more downside ahead unless the company raises capital or demand meaningfully recovers.

      "content": "Trump's Tariff Bomb Just Crushed Tesla's Next Big Thing Khac Phu Nguyen April 16, 2025 2 min read In this article: TSLA Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) just hit a wallone built by Washington. The company has been forced to suspend shipments of key parts from China, parts critical to kickstarting production of its upcoming Cybercab and Semi electric trucks. The reason? A brutal escalation in U.S. tariffs. After absorbing the initial 34% tariff hike, Tesla simply couldn't make the math work when the rate ballooned to 145%, or even 245% . The delay now clouds Tesla's trial production plans for October and threatens its full-scale 2026 rolloutat a time when Musk had been hyping these models as growth engines for the next decade. The Cybercab, a steering wheelfree, sub-$30,000 robotaxi, was set to roll off lines in Texas. The Semi, designed to disrupt long-haul trucking, was headed for Nevada. Both are now stuck in limbo. Tesla had been gradually shifting to North American suppliers in anticipation of tariff risks, but the sudden shock left little room to maneuver. Ironically, the tariffsintended to bring manufacturing homeare now sidelining Musk, one of the most outspoken champions of U.S. innovation. The White House says companies \"need a little time\" to adapt. Tesla, clearly, needs a little more than that. Meanwhile, the hits keep coming. China has responded with a 125% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, prompting Tesla to halt new orders for its Model S and X in the country. Musk, who recently shared a video explaining how even a pencil depends on a global supply chain, has made personal appeals to Trump to walk back the sweeping measures. So far, no dice. Tesla's ambitionsfor robotaxis, electric semis, and even fulfilling long-overdue orders to Pepsinow face delays and uncertainty. And if this is how America treats its own top manufacturers, global investors might be wonderingwho's next? This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

      "title": "Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) a Reddit Stock with High Potential?",
      "content": "Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) a Reddit Stock with High Potential? Maham Fatima April 16, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA RDDT We recently published a list of the 12 Reddit Stocks with High Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other Reddit stocks with high potential. On April 15, Monica Guerra, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Head of US Policy, joined ‘Closing Bell Overtime’ on CNBC to discuss how investors should avoid knee-jerk reactions when it comes to volatility. Monica Guerra pointed out the significance of focusing on President Trump’s statements, as they contribute to market volatility despite their mixed and unclear nature. She acknowledged that deciphering his comments is challenging because they lack clarity but staying attentive to both presidential statements and congressional actions is still crucial. She stressed that policy certainty might emerge once Congress finalizes the budget, which is expected around August this year. She also emphasized that while the day started positively with markets up by 0.79%, the situation otherwise remains uncertain. She reminded clients that the 90-day reprieve on tariffs is not the end of the story and the ongoing studies on semiconductors could lead to additional pressures related to tariffs and market volatility. Guerra noted that tariff revenues are being considered as funding sources for tax cuts and this interplay between tariffs and taxes could influence market volatility. On discussing future developments in tariff policy, she mentioned that more than 70 countries have approached President Trump in attempts to renegotiate the universal 10% tariff and reciprocal tariffs. She cautioned that even if reciprocal tariffs are eliminated and only the universal tariff remains, additional increases could be highly inflationary. China’s effective tariff rate is already at 145% and adding reciprocal tariffs could push inflationary pressures further. Guerra advised clients against reacting impulsively to such news and encouraged them to focus on long-term investment goals. Our Methodology We sifted through Reddit threads to make a list of the top stocks with the highest analysts’ upside potential (at least 30%) as of April 15. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Story Continues Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Average Upside Potential as of April 15: 36.71% Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) deals in electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems through its two segments. The Automotive segment offers EVs and related products and services. The Energy Generation and Storage segment offers solar energy generation and energy storage products and services. The company’s autonomous driving and AI-related initiatives are anticipated to eventually make up 90% of its valuation. Optimus alone can generate more than $10 trillion in revenue for Tesla. On April 14, Deutsche Bank reiterated a Buy rating on the company because it expects Tesla to do well in the long run because of these advancements and the ability to utilize AI in its products. However, the bank does acknowledge the short-term volatility that the business faces right now. Still, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is somewhat insulated from the current tariff environments when compared to other major automakers in the US. This is because Tesla has a higher degree of vertical integration and makes the majority of its parts itself, something that traditional automakers lack. However, Tesla heavily relies on international sources, mainly China, for a significant amount of its parts and batteries. JDP Capital Management initiated the stock in June 2024 and stated the following regarding Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is new core position that I wrote about in 2024 Half Year Letter. The stock was up 115% in 2024. We benefited from the June 2024 timing of our purchase, buying after the stock had declined about 30% in the first part of the year. Overall, TSLA ranks 9th on our list of the 12 Reddit stocks with high potential. While we acknowledge the growth potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

      "content": "Tesla registrations slump 15% in EV-loving California Akash Sriram April 16, 2025 2 min read In this article: TSLA By Akash Sriram (Reuters) -Californians further soured on Tesla in the first quarter, pulling down the electric-vehicle maker's registrations by 15% as backlash against Elon Musk's company intensified in the state that has embraced EVs most across the United States. The drop-off means Tesla no longer accounts for a majority of the EV market share in the state, according to the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). There have been relentless protests in many cities in California - echoing the backlash in other countries - against Musk's involvement in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and his embrace of far-right politics in Europe, a key factor behind Tesla's 13% drop in first-quarter deliveries globally. California's embrace of EVs makes Tesla's falloff more concerning given that overall zero-emission vehicle sales in the state rose 7.3% during the first three months of the year. While Tesla's market share fell to 43.9% from 55.5% a year earlier, brands such as Honda, Ford and GM's Chevrolet grew their footprint. \"An aging product lineup and backlash against Musk's political initiatives are likely key factors for the decline in Tesla BEV market share,\" the CNCDA said in a statement on Wednesday. Tesla shares fell 5.2%; they have lost nearly half their value since peaking in mid-December. Investors will be closely watching Tesla's earnings release on Tuesday to see whether the company will maintain its growth forecast for the year in light of the decline in sales in key markets evidenced in the first quarter. Analysts have steadily reduced their estimates for its first-quarter results to a mean of 42 cents a share, according to data compiled by LSEG, down from 69 cents three months ago. California accounts for nearly a third of Tesla's sales in the U.S., according to Reuters calculations based on data from Cox Automotive and the CNCDA. That makes it an outsized contributor to the EV maker's success in America, as the state accounted for roughly 13% of new registrations of gasoline-powered light vehicles in 2023, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. While Tesla's Model Y SUV remained the best-selling EV in the state, its sales plummeted about 30% in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, the CNCDA said. Tesla said earlier this month that retooling production lines for a refreshed Model Y resulted in several weeks of lost production. The CNCDA also expects total new vehicle registrations in the state to fall 2.3% in 2025 from last year due to U.S. trade policies.

      "content": "There are 'definitely buying opportunities' in the tech sell-off Brad Smith and Madison Mills April 16, 2025 In this video: TSLA NVDA GOOG MSFT Nvidia ( NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ), and ASML ( ASML ) are dragging the market lower as investors weigh the impact of the US-China trade war and a potential economic slowdown fueled by US President Trump's policies. Summit Global Investments chief investment officer David Harden sits down with Madison Mills and Brad Smith to discuss how to play the tech sector, comparing Microsoft ( MSFT ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A It's time now for today's strategy session. US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning. 00:18 David Harden Thank you. 00:19 Speaker A Are you buying big tech at these levels? 00:23 David Harden Well, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google. 00:49 Speaker A I think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that? 01:29 David Harden Yeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it. 02:11 Speaker A And we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs? 02:32 David Harden I I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech. 03:24 Speaker A It seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead? 03:42 David Harden No, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at. 04:24 Speaker A I want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels? 04:31 David Harden Uh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy. 04:44 Speaker A And I know one of them is Microsoft, correct? 04:48 David Harden I if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels. 05:19 Speaker A And I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla. 05:26 David Harden Well, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now. 06:11 Speaker A Outside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now? 06:17 David Harden And I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things. 06:26 Speaker A It seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like. 06:33 David Harden Oh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now. 06:56 Speaker A Absolutely. David, great to see you here in studio. Thanks for taking the time with us this morning. 07:01 David Harden Thank you. 07:02 Speaker A Absolutely.

      "content": "‘China’s Elon Musk’ uses just two numbers to demonstrate why his country’s auto industry is now outcompeting the U.S. and Europe XPeng founder He Xiaopeng, speaking at his global brand night in Hong Kong, highlighted the breathtaking speed of innovation in the Chinese auto market over the course of a decade. · Fortune · Lam Yik—Bloomberg/Getty Images Christiaan Hetzner April 16, 2025 3 min read In this article: XPEV TSLA Xpeng cofounder He Xiaopeng says the number of new electric vehicles equipped with highly automated “hands-off” driver assist features sold in China has soared in just a decade and is now outpacing its peers in the West . If you want to know why the most technologically advanced cars are currently built in China rather than the United States or Europe, two numbers describe the breakneck pace of innovation there. Fifty represents the penetration rate of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) as a share of the overall Chinese market. In other words, an EV or plug-in hybrid constitutes every other new car sold last year. The second number, 55.7, represents the percentage of NEVs sold last year that came equipped with “hands-off” automated driving assist systems, similar to features like Tesla’s Full Self-Driving or Ford’s BlueCruise. To put that in perspective, when He Xiaopeng helped found New York–listed Chinese EV maker XPeng back in 2014, these figures were both below 1%. “One can tell that great improvements in development have been witnessed in China for the past decade,” said He, speaking on Tuesday at his global brand night held this year in Hong Kong, where his premium X9 family van was the star of the show. Ten years may seem like quite a while in the consumer electronics industry, but in the safety-obsessed auto business, it is roughly the time span of one full product life cycle, starting with the design of a new model and ending with its final year of production. By comparison, overall U.S. sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids are only roughly 11% of its light vehicle market, with Europe higher at 23%. When it comes to driver assist features, it’s difficult to find directly comparable stats. But using Tesla as a proxy, the most technologically advanced hands-off feature is present in perhaps only a quarter of its cars, and CEO Elon Musk cut the price twice to spur demand . U.S. and European policymakers are now forced to slap on steep tariffs to prevent their home markets from being inundated with affordable Chinese EVs. But CEO He is optimistic about XPeng making an impact abroad, too: “Over the next decade we aim for over half of our sales to come from overseas, striving to really dominate as China’s leading mid- to high-end export brand.” Recently, Volkswagen—for decades the undisputed market leader in China thanks to its first-mover advantage—has entered into a direct partnership with He’s XPeng. Who is He Xiaopeng? With the money he made from selling popular mobile browser provider UCWeb to Alibaba, He launched EV maker XPeng. Story Continues This is similar to Musk, who took his PayPal earnings from the eBay sale to invest in an obscure young EV startup Tesla back in 2004 . To Tesla loyalists, He is often seen as a Musk imitator, following a familiar playbook—almost to the letter. Like Musk, He has developed custom silicon chips for autonomous driving, built a humanoid robot (dubbed “Iron”), and expanded into aerospace. The difference: instead of rockets, He is betting on flying cars. Still, XPeng operates in a vastly different league from Tesla when it comes to scale and market value. Tesla enjoyed a near-monopoly in the West for years, thanks to its technological edge, vertically integrated software, and dominant Supercharger network. In contrast, XPeng has had to battle a crowded Chinese market led by BYD and filled with ambitious rivals. As a result, XPeng remains a fraction of Tesla’s size, jockeying for position around seventh or eighth place among China’s new energy vehicle brands. Whether He’s company can survive China’s ongoing EV price war is a question still very much in play.

      "title": "After surge to record highs, gold overtakes 'Magnificent 7' as the most crowded trade on Wall Street",
      "content": "After surge to record highs, gold overtakes 'Magnificent 7' as the most crowded trade on Wall Street Ines Ferré · Senior Business Reporter Updated April 16, 2025 2 min read In this article: DX=F MSFT GOOG AMZN NVDA Gold has surpassed the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop. According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey. Gold futures ( GC=F ) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to favor the safe-haven asset amid a falling US dollar ( DX-Y.NYB ) and tariff uncertainty. Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are down considerably. Read more: How to invest in gold in 4 steps Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%. Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. In a regulatory filing, the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares. Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year. Gold's rally comes as central banks' demand hit all-time highs last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). \"The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,\" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance. \"Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.\" Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, upping their price forecasts on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent. Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America. The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying \"US exceptionalism\" has peaked.

In this podcast, Motley Fool Senior Analyst Matt Argersinger caught up with Damodaran at The Motley Fool's Market Playbook Summit. They discussed: How politics and investing have become intertwined. Damodaran's view on \"Magnificent Seven\" valuations. The role of taxes in deciding whether to buy or sell stocks. Motley Fool members can find replays from the entire event at live.fool.com. To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center . When you're ready to invest, check out this top 10 list of stocks to buy . A full transcript is below. This video was recorded on April 12, 2025 Aswath Damodaran: I talked about this yesterday in class I gave my students a question. I said, let's suppose you value a company and you feel 100% certain about the value, and the value is higher than the price. Would you be willing to take all of your money and buy the stock? After all, you're 100% convinced about the value, it is undervalued. What I want them to think about is even though you're 100% certain about the value, there's another dynamic here that you don't control, which is to make money, the price has to move to value. Ricky Mulvey: I'm Ricky Mulvey, and that's Aswath Damodaran. He teaches corporate finance and valuation at the Stern School of Business at New York University. He's written several books on equity valuation, and he's one of the most respected minds in the space. My colleague Matt Argersinger interviewed Damodaran for our Market Playbook Summit, an event where Motley Fool members first caught this conversation. They discuss why the US is still a safe haven for investors compared to some other parts of the world, how Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration changes Tesla 's valuation, and why the rise of passive investing isn't stopping anytime soon. It's a great conversation, and I think you'll find value in it. Matt Argersinger: The theme of our discussion today is investing in uncertainty. Well, it feels like as investors are always investing in uncertainty. Otherwise, equity investors probably wouldn't have earned such outsized returns historically. But I guess my first question, recently, outside of maybe the onset of COVID in early 2020 and certainly the global financial crisis of 2008. Does today this moment feel more uncertain to you than maybe recent times? Aswath Damodaran: Well, it's a fairly US centric question, too. The reason I bring that up is six weeks ago, actually, not less than that, two weeks ago. I did a valuation seminar for Turkish investors. If you think you face a lot of uncertainty in the US, you should put yourself in Turkey right now. Inflation is at 20%, interest rates are 25%. The political environment is unstable to say the least. Everything is relative. Relative to Turkey, we're an ocean of stability. The world has always been bundle of uncertainties with different parts of the world feeling different amounts. In the US, we had the luxury of the 20th century, and it's a luxury of being the most mean reverting, most predictable economy and market of all time. I'll be quite honest, we got spoiled. We got spoiled in the way we think about investing. We got spoiled in terms of how we invest. We developed investment philosophies of basically mean reversion in fancy form. You buy low PE stocks. Why? Because you always go back to the average. You buy stocks, and the margin goes down because the margin always reverts back. Mean reversion was the driving force between much of valuation and active investing in the 20th century, and it worked. You bought low PE stocks, you beat the market by 3, 4, 5% of the year. You bought small companies, you beat the market. I think that what's changed is the US is very much part of a global environment where everything is uncertain. Of course, we've added to that uncertainty with political choices and executive choices that drive it. But I don't think of this as particularly unique if you think about investors in a more general scale than as opposed to investors just in the US. Matt Argersinger: That's a great perspective. I guess, since you mentioned Turkers students and how they're thinking about their economy and their political situation, maybe I'll ask this, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable for us in the US, because we don't think about it very much. But it does feel somewhat unavoidable at the moment. You wrote recently in your Musings on Market blog, which for viewers here can be found at aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com. Fantastic site. You wrote that politics and investing have joined together in a way perhaps they never had before, at least in recent history. I'd love to ask what do you mean by that? And does it factor into your approach at all when it comes to valuation or estimating the equity premium in the market? Aswath Damodaran: Well, the two things I always go back to and I feel unsettled. You're right, we feel a little unsettled because it looks like the world order that we all grew up in. Post World War II with first with the Cold War and then with the US as the center of the global economy. It feels like that's shifting. When things start to shift, you start to feel uncomfortable in your personal life, in your political life, and your economic life, and your investing life. Everyone I talk to feels a little unsettled. It feels like everything they've learned to know is up for questioning. It's not the first time that's happened in this century. In 2008, everything we knew about markets got shaken up by a crisis that cut to the heart of, can we really trust governments and central banks to make the right judgments? I did what I did then, as well, which is when I feel unsettled, there are two things I do. One is, I elevate. I try to get perspective, rather than react to whatever the new story of the day is, which right now is easy to do. It's a tariff today, a tariff tomorrow. Who knows what the day after will bring? Which is a really bad place to be as an investor, because if you're reactive, we've already lost control of the game. I step back and say, why are these things happening? What are the forces that are driving it? Because I'm convinced that what we're seeing play out is the culmination of a global backlash that started after 2008, where we started to lose trust in all the institutions that had given us globalization. The second, I think, is we're seeing a force that was in private business disruption, a force that we took for granted in Silicon Valley and technology make its way into government. It actually started in Latin America with Nayib Bukele EI Salvador and Javier Milei saying, \"We can bring what we do in companies, disruption, break the process up and start that process has entered governments, and that is unsettling, as well.\" The second is going back to basics. The value of a company has always been about cash flows, growth, and risk, and it will always be about cash flows, growth, and risk. But no matter what's happening out there, ultimately for it to affect value, it's got to show up in one of those four places, one or more of those four places. I go back to basics and say, OK, there's trade wars, maybe around the horizon. There might be taxes changing. Where would I expect to see that play out with individual companies? If nothing else, and this might be purely for just comfort, it makes me feel more secure with where I am. I write stuff often to get things off my chest, to get my thoughts organized. That was as much as my reader being my psychiatrist saying, here's where I am in the process. Here's how I'm reasoning my way through. I don't know whether I have the answer yet, but this is the pathway I'm going to use to try to get to an answer. But I think if you're feeling unsettled righ"

      "content": "Tesla Suspends China Part Imports Amid Tariff Surge, Shares Slip Nauman khan April 16, 2025 1 min read In this article: TSLA Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) saw its stock fall by 2% in early Wednesday trading after the company halted importing essential parts from China for its Cybercab and Semi trucks, according to a Reuters report. The move comes amid a fresh flare-up in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, with President Donald Trump increasing tariffs on Chinese imports. Earlier this month, Trump raised tariffs to a total of 145%, putting pressure on Tesla's supply chain. While the company had absorbed a 34% tariff before, it could not absorb the additional costs that the latest hikes brought. This pause in imports could disrupt Tesla's efforts to expand into autonomous vehicles, a sector CEO Elon Musk has frequently highlighted as a key growth opportunity. Although Tesla manufactures its U.S. vehicles locally, it still relies on imports for certain critical components, many of which come from China. The company is already grappling with declining sales, fierce competition from Chinese automakers, and a shift in consumer preference toward hybrid cars. Adding to the pressure is a consumer boycott in Europe, fueled by Musk's political stances. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener. POTENTIAL TARIFF DELAY: Shares of car manufacturers Ford ( F), General Motors ( GM) and Stellantis ( STLA) were Trump told reporters that his administration is “looking at something to help car companies” as they slowly move manufacturing to the U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that, “I’m looking at something to help car companies with it. They’re switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places, and they need a little bit of time, because they’re going to make them here.” Wedbush notes that President Trump has floated the idea of delaying/pausing the auto tariffs facing the Detroit Big 3 — General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis — and Tesla (TSLA) among foreign automakers. The firm continues to believe the 25% auto tariffs will ultimately be focused on finished cars vs. auto parts at the end of the day, which would be a clear positive vs. the original auto parts tariffs. Flipping upside down a global supply chain that has been in place for decades cannot happen overnight for the auto industry and Wedbush strongly believes the clear right move would be to focus on finished cars made in the U.S. vs. the auto parts component tariff angle. MOVING TO SIDELINES ON GM: Barclays downgraded General Motors to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $40, down from $70. The firm downgraded a handful of names and reduced estimates in the autos and mobility group to reflect the earnings impacts from tariffs. Barclays also downgraded its industry view on the sector to Negative. A “highly challenging environment” makes a near-term investment case for the autos sector is “increasingly difficult,” the firm tells investors in a research note. It sees multiple near-term pressures, including earnings pressure, risks to consumer health, and a cloud over auto tech investment. “Auto tariffs are seemingly here to stay, and valuations are seemingly not pricing in full tariff risk,” contends Barclays. The downgrade of GM reflects the company’s “significant risk” to near-term earnings from tariffs. Barclays maintains a slight preference for Ford over GM. DELIVERY HALT: China has ordered its airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing ( BA) jets as part of the tit-for-tat trade war that’s seen U.S. President Donald Trump levy tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods, Bloomberg reports , citing people familiar with the matter. Beijing has also asked that Chinese carriers halt any purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing matters that are private. Story Continues Morgan Stanley notes that China has ordered its airlines not to take any further deliveries of Boeing aircraft in response to the U.S. decision to impose 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and that Beijing has also asked that Chinese carriers halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies. However, considering that China has not ordered many Boeing aircraft in the past few years and that Boeing aircraft deliveries to China only constitute less than 6% of total Boeing deliveries in 2025-2028, the firm sees “minimal downside risk for Boeing compared to 10 years ago,” when China accounted for about 20% of deliveries on a given year. It maintains an Equal Weight rating and $175 price target on Boeing shares. PERMITS: President Donald Trump stated in a Truth Social post , “NVIDIA ( NVDA) COMMITS 500 BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD A.I. SUPERCOMPUTERS, PLUS, IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCLUSIVELY. This is very big and exciting news. All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!” BOOSTING U.S. PRODUCTION: Honda (HMC) is considering plans to shift the production of models to the U.S. from Mexico and Canada in response to an additional 25% tariff imposed by Donald Trump on all imported vehicles, Nikkei Asia’s Shoya Okinaga reports , citing sources. The automaker will boost the production of automobiles in the U.S. by up to 30% over two to three years, enabling the company to meet 90% of unit sales in the country with locally produced cars. LVMH ( LVMUY) is considering moving some of its manufacturing to the U.S. amid Donald Trump’s tariff threats, Business Insider’s Aditi Bharade reports , citing comments made on the company’s investor call. CFO Cecile Cabanis said there is “still capacity” to increase production of Louis Vuitton products in the U.S. and there is “still some room” for Tiffany & Co. to shift production from Europe to the U.S. “So we are looking at that, obviously,” she said, adding increasing U.S. production is “something that you don’t do overnight.” Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "content": "Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Buy So Far in 2025? Maham Fatima April 16, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of 13 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy So Far in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025. On April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty. Ives thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors. Our Methodology We sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Story Continues Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Buy So Far in 2025? Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, along with energy generation and storage systems internationally. It operates in two segments, Automotive; and Energy Generation & Storage. The Automotive segment offers EVs, automotive regulatory credits, and vehicle insurance services. The other segment engages with solar energy generation and energy storage products. RBC Capital Markets global autos analyst Tom Narayan recently lowered the company’s price target from $440 to $320. Narayan’s adjustment was a result of the increased competition in the FSD market. The analyst also revised his pricing forecast for Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) FSD and lowered it from $100 to $50 per month because he anticipates that autonomous driving technology could soon become standard and widely available. However, the company’s autonomous driving and AI-related initiatives, such as the Optimus robot program, could potentially make up 90% of its total valuation. Optimus, in particular, is expected to bring over $10 trillion to the company in the long run. The company is designing all components for Optimus from scratch, to use it internally at its facilities in 2025. This means building around 10,000 units in a year. It’s also important to note that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) anticipates Optimus training needs to be ten times greater than autonomous vehicles. JDP Capital Management is positive on Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) due to the potential of its FSD and Optimus technologies. It stated the following regarding the company in its Q4 2024 investor letter : “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is new core position that I wrote about in 2024 Half Year Letter. The stock was up 115% in 2024. We benefited from the June 2024 timing of our purchase, buying after the stock had declined about 30% in the first part of the year. Overall, TSLA ranks 9th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Analysts forecast revenue around $21.81 billion and earnings per share of $0.43both down from Q4 2024, when Tesla pulled in $27.2 billion and $0.74 per share. That drop reflects the challenges the company has faced lately. The big issue? Production and delivery numbers. Tesla built 362,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a 16% year-over-year decline. Deliveries weren't much better, hitting 336,681 units, down 13%. It's Tesla's weakest quarter for deliveries in three years and came in below Wall Street expectations, raising fresh concerns about demand and growth momentum. Margins are another pressure point. Tesla has been working hard to lower its costsbringing the average cost to build a car from over $38,000 in early 2023 to under $35,000 by the end of 2024. Whether that trend continued into Q1 could be key for profitability, especially with margins forecast to slip to 15.8%. Still, there's a bright spot. Tesla's energy divisionthanks to growing interest in Megapack and Powerwall productshas been expanding fast. The segment now accounts for roughly 10% of Tesla's revenue and saw 67% growth last year.

      "content": "Insights Into Tesla (TSLA) Q1: Wall Street Projections for Key Metrics Zacks Equity Research April 16, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA In its upcoming report, Tesla (TSLA) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share, reflecting no change compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $21.85 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 2.6%. Over the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted downward by 18.1% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period. Before a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock. While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective. That said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Tesla metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor. The consensus estimate for 'Revenues- Automotive sales' stands at $15.69 billion. The estimate points to a change of -4.7% from the year-ago quarter. It is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- Energy generation and storage' will reach $3.11 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +90.4% year over year. The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenues- Services and other' of $2.93 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +28.2% year over year. The average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- Automotive regulatory credits' at $523.01 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.3%. Analysts predict that the 'Revenues- Automotive leasing' will reach $430.71 million. The estimate indicates a change of -9.5% from the prior-year quarter. Analysts' assessment points toward 'Geographic Revenues- United States' reaching $11.07 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +13.4% from the prior-year quarter. According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenues- Other International' should come in at $7.21 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +3.9% year over year. The consensus among analysts is that 'Geographic Revenues- China' will reach $4.80 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +4.6% from the prior-year quarter. Story Continues Analysts expect 'Total vehicle deliveries' to come in at 365,199. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 386,810. The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Other models deliveries' will likely reach 17,095. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 17,027 in the same quarter of the previous year. Analysts forecast 'Model 3/Y deliveries' to reach 351,158.

      "title": "Tesla and Detroit Carmakers Could Dodge Tariff Hit if Delay Holds",
      "content": "Tesla and Detroit Carmakers Could Dodge Tariff Hit if Delay Holds Muslim Farooque April 16, 2025 1 min read In this article: TSLA A delay in implementing U.S. automotive tariffs may offer a break for Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and major American automakers such as General Motors ( NYSE:GM ), Ford Motor ( NYSE:F ), and Stellantis ( NYSE:STLA ), according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The original plan, announced by President Donald Trump in March, involved a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and components. While the vehicle tariffs went into effect on April 3, tariffs on auto parts were due to follow by early May. Ives previously criticized the tariff policy, warning it could sharply increase vehicle prices, estimating costs could rise by $5,000 to $10,000 per unit. He emphasized that fully domestic vehicle manufacturing is largely unrealistic. In Wedbush's view, focusing the tariffs solely on fully built vehicles rather than on imported components would be a far less disruptive approach for the U.S. car industry. That's because domestic production remains heavily reliant on imported parts, even for vehicles assembled in the U.S. The firm also noted the challenge in quickly shifting away from a global supply chain that has developed over decades.

      "content": "Tesla’s (TSLA) Energy Segment Could Be the Next Growth Driver, While Investors Focus on EVs TipRanks April 16, 2025 2 min read In this article: TSLA While Tesla (TSLA) is best known for revolutionizing the electric vehicle (EV) industry, its lesser-known energy segment is quietly gaining momentum. As investors fixate on vehicle deliveries and margins, Tesla’s energy division, including battery storage, solar solutions, and grid-scale power systems, could be the company’s next major growth engine. Stay Ahead of the Market: Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks. Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener. Tesla’s energy storage segment includes products like the Megapack and Powerwall to store electricity for use in homes, businesses, and utility-scale projects. Tesla Energy Powers Ahead with Impressive Gains According to Main Street Data , Tesla’s automotive segment still accounts for most of its revenue. However, the energy segment has shown impressive year-over-year growth. In Q4 2024, Tesla reported $3.06 billion in revenue from energy generation and storage, marking an outstanding 113% increase from the prior year. The segment contributed nearly 12% to the company’s total revenue for the quarter. In 2024, this division generated nearly $10.1 billion in revenue, marking a 67% year-over-year increase. Additionally, in terms of gross margins, Tesla’s energy segment surpasses its other divisions. In Q4, the energy segment recorded a margin of 25.2%, compared to the automobile segment’s margin of 16.6%. Main Street Data also underscores the solid momentum in Tesla’s Energy division in Q1 2025. The company deployed 10.4k MWh (megawatt-hour) of energy storage systems, which was more than double the 4.05k MWh deployed in the same quarter last year. This was Tesla’s second-best quarter ever for energy deployments, trailing only Q4 2024. Is Tesla a Good Stock to Buy Right Now? Despite the strong performance of Tesla’s energy segment, the company’s overall share price continues to face pressure. Weak electric vehicle (EV) sales, rising competition, and mounting backlash against CEO Elon Musk have weighed heavily on investor sentiment. While the energy division shows promise as a future growth driver, it hasn’t yet been enough to offset concerns in Tesla’s core automotive business. On Wall Street, analysts have maintained a neutral stance on Tesla stock . According to TipRanks, TSLA stock has received a Hold consensus rating, with 16 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sells assigned in the last three months. The average price target for Tesla shares is $305.93, suggesting a potential upside of 21.23% from the current level.

      "content": "Exclusive-Trump's tariffs on Chinese parts for Cybercab, Semi disrupt Tesla's US production plans, source says Los Angeles Auto Show · Reuters Reuters April 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Tesla's plans to ship components from China for Cybercab and Semi electric trucks in the United States were suspended after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods amid a trade war, said a person with direct knowledge. The move could disrupt Tesla's plan to start mass production of the much-anticipated models, which its CEO Elon Musk has been touting to investors as major innovations providing growth momentum of the U.S. automaker. Tesla was ready to absorb the additional costs when Trump imposed the 34% tariff on Chinese goods but could not do so when the tariff went beyond that, leaving shipping plans suspended, said the person, who declined to be named as the matter is private. Trump raised additional tariffs to 84% on April 9 and has since increased that to 125%, bringing the total tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the U.S. to 145%. The company was scheduled to start receiving component shipments in upcoming months with the goal of starting trial production of the two models in October and mass production in 2026, the person said, with Cybercab to be produced in Texas and Semi in Nevada. It was not clear how long the suspension will last. Tesla has for the past two years been increasing the proportion of parts sourced from North America for its U.S. factories in view of potential U.S. tariffs on China, the source and a second person said. Speaking on Monday at the White House, Trump said he was considering a modification to the 25% tariffs imposed on foreign auto and auto parts imports from Mexico, Canada and other places. Those tariffs could raise the costs of a car by thousands of dollars, and Trump said car companies \"need a little bit of time because they're going to make 'em here.\" Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment. Tesla has been seeking approvals from state governments as it plans to roll out a robotaxi service with a fleet of Cybercabs. It unveiled in October a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals and promised to start building the two-door model by 2026 at a price of less than $30,000. Tesla also plans to ramp up production of the Semi electric trucks in 2026 and accelerate deliveries of long-overdue orders to customers including Pepsi. The impact on the key business plans for Tesla reflected how Trump's tariffs, which were meant to boost U.S. local manufacturing, has hurt his political ally Musk, who has repeatedly said on his social media posts on X he supported free trade and objected tariffs. The White House says Musk is tasked with overseeing a U.S. bureaucracy overhaul that has eliminated the jobs of thousands of government employees. Story Continues Musk, who posted a video illustrating how it requires a global supply chain to make a pencil, had made personal appeal to Trump to reverse sweeping new tariffs worldwide, Washington Post reported last week. Tesla has also stopped taking new orders for Model S and Model X as China imposed a retaliatory 125% tariff on U.S. goods. The U.S. accounted for about 15%-20% by value of exports of Chinese auto components in recent years, S&P said in a report in February. (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom.

      "title": "Is Rivian Stock a Buy Now?",
      "content": "Is Rivian Stock a Buy Now? By Geoffrey Seiler – Apr 15, 2025 at 9:29PM Key Points Rivian has been a very volatile stock. The young company now must navigate tariffs and an uncertain economy. However, Tesla's struggles could be its gains. NASDAQ : RIVN Rivian Automotive Market Cap $16B Today's Change angle-down ( -0.84 %) $ 0.11 Current Price $ 12.98 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET Even before the market's recent volatility, Rivian Automotive ( RIVN 0.84% ) has been a stock accustomed to seeing large price fluctuations. At one point last year, it fell about 65% from January to April after poor delivery numbers, only to soar more than 100% from its lows on the news of a partnership with Volkswagen . When the dust finally cleared, the stock ended 2024 down about 42%. Rivian's stock started 2025 on a positive note, quickly spiking higher. However, with the market downturn, it is now down about 15% on the year as of this writing. If history is any indication, shares are likely to remain volatile. The question, though, is whether the long-term prospects are enough to make the stock a buy right now. Can Rivian take advantage of Musk's missteps? Elon Musk's foray into politics and DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) has clearly hurt Tesla and opened the door for electric vehicle (EV) rivals like Rivian. Musk's actions have ked to a significant portion of its consumer base souring on the brand both in the U.S. and overseas. Expand NASDAQ : RIVN Rivian Automotive Today's Change ( -0.84 %) $ -0.11 Current Price $ 12.98 Key Data Points Market Cap $16B Day's Range $ 12.94 - $ 13.27 52wk Range $ 9.50 - $ 17.15 Volume 28M Avg Vol 44M Gross Margin -988.16 % Dividend Yield N/A To make matters worse, the segment of the population he has angered are people who were likely more apt to buy an EV in the first place. The declining favorability of Musk and the Tesla brand could be seen in its latest first-quarter unit delivery numbers, which fell 13% in the quarter. However, Rivian saw an even sharper decline, with deliveries down 36% to 8,640 vehicles. Still, its deliveries came in ahead of analyst expectations for 8,200 vehicles. On its fourth-quarter earnings call in February, management said it expected first-quarter sales to decline to around 8,000 vehicles due to seasonality, a challenging demand environment, and the impact of the fires in Los Angeles, which has historically been one of the company's biggest markets. This could be both a transitional and transformative year for Rivian, and the damage to the Tesla brand could help the company over the long run. But it first must deal with the impact of tariffs . Although the company does its manufacturing in the U.S., it sources many of its components and raw materials from outside the U.S., like other automakers. The company just managed to turn gross-margin positive last quarter, when it produced a modest gross profit. Its fourth-quarter automotive segment's margins were a slim 7%, while its software and service margins were 28%. As such, it doesn't have much wiggle room to absorb increased costs. Management has already gone to great strides to lower its production and manufacturing costs. It switched to a design that significantly reduces the number of electronic control units and the amount of wiring in its vehicles, while it also reworked its factory. At the same time, the current demand environment and the economy may also not lend itself to increasing prices. Rivian is already selling a luxury-priced vehicle at a slim margin, which indicates that it doesn't have a huge amount of pricing power without hurting deliveries. This puts the company in a tough position in the near term. However, Rivian is also in the midst of a big transformation. It will shut down its factory for a month this year to prepare for the launch of its new R2 SUV in 2026. Before the tariffs, this new model SUV was expected to start at a price of around $45,000. The R2 is meant to bring the brand to a much wider audience of buyers. From there, it will look to scale up with a new factory in Georgia. Is the stock a buy? With the backing of Volkswagen and Amazon, Rivian does have a runway to continue to invest in and scale up its business. However, given its early-stage nature with its sub-scale and cash burn, there remains considerable risk. The current trade war with China and uncertainty over tariffs with other countries just adds another layer to this risk. However, if the company can navigate this environment, it will be in a pretty good position given the damage suffered by the Tesla brand. This isn't something that Musk is going to be able to walk back, so there is a clear opportunity for another company to step into the luxury EV market and take share. With Rivian turning gross-margin positive, scaling up its manufacturing, and set to offer a lower-priced model, it is one of the companies best positioned to do this. All in all, Rivian is a speculative stock. It has solid potential upside, but it's also a boom-or-bust type of stock. As such, investors can consider buying the stock here, but they must size positions accordingly.

      "content": "'Musk Could Not Tolerate Seeing Such Success' — OpenAI Says He Abandoned And Declared Them 'Doomed,' Then Tried to Destroy It All Jeannine Mancini April 15, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA If you ask OpenAI , Elon Musk didn't just walk away from the company he helped build — he lit the match and now wants to watch it burn. In a scorching new legal filing, OpenAI fired back at Musk's ongoing lawsuit with a detailed and unfiltered version of events — accusing him of abandoning the company, declaring it dead on arrival, and later launching a campaign to destroy it when it refused to hand him the reins. \"Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed,\" OpenAI's legal team wrote in a Wednesday court filing . \"He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead — not for humanity but for Elon Musk.\" Don't Miss: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now . Invest in the Future of Digital Engagement. Own a Piece of the $100 Billion Metaverse Today for Just $500. The filing claims Musk weaponized everything in his arsenal — from his massive social media following to legal threats — to kneecap the company once it became clear he couldn't control it. \"The ensuing campaign has been relentless,\" the filing added. \"Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk's more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI's assets , Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI.\" The legal battle began when Musk sued OpenAI in February 2024, alleging the company had strayed from its original nonprofit mission and formed a for-profit structure that favors Microsoft. Musk dropped the suit in June — only to refile it in August. On Wednesday, the judge scheduled a trial for next March. Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! But OpenAI isn't just playing defense. On the same day as the filing, the company posted a series of sharp jabs at Musk on X . \"Elon's nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\" the company posted. \"Elon's never been about the mission. He's always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit — his own emails prove it. When he didn't get his way, he stormed off.\" Story Continues The post continued, \"Elon is undoubtedly one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time. But these antics are just history on repeat – Elon being all about Elon.\" Musk's Early Role — and Abrupt Exit Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 alongside Sam Altman and others, helping launch the nonprofit with a vision of building artificial intelligence that benefits all of humanity. He pledged $1 billion in support, though OpenAI later said he only contributed a fraction of that before stepping away. Trending: With Shares Starting at Just $1.52, This Could be Your Chance to Invest in the Future of Healthcare. By 2018, tensions were rising. Musk reportedly proposed taking over the company and folding it into Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) — a move that other board members rejected. Musk left the board shortly after. At the time, Musk publicly said he walked away to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla's own AI work and because he \"didn't agree with some of what the OpenAI team wanted to do.\" He didn't elaborate on what those differences were, but former employees have hinted that the disagreements ran deep. Altman, for his part, has rarely spoken publicly about the split — until now. Wednesday's court filing paints Musk as someone who believed OpenAI was doomed without his leadership. But when the company went on to create the most widely-used AI product in history — ChatGPT — it says Musk couldn't stand being left behind. Now, Musk is backing xAI , his own AI startup launched in 2023, which he claims will build a safer, more transparent artificial intelligence model. Its first product, Grok, is integrated into X.

If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' The Bigger Battle Over AI's Future While the courtroom fireworks keep flying, this fight goes beyond just bruised egos. At the heart of Musk's lawsuit is a claim that OpenAI's for-profit pivot violates the company's founding agreement and undermines its mission to serve humanity. But OpenAI insists that Musk knew about — and even supported — the pivot, right up until he didn't get his way. Now, OpenAI is asking the court to toss Musk's claims entirely. With a trial date set, the world's biggest names in AI look ready for a long, ugly fight — one that could shape the future of artificial intelligence, and who gets to control it.

(TSLA): Seen as an ‘Embodied AI Secular Winner’ Ghazal Ahmed April 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks to watch amid market volatility. The uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors’ readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains. The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components. READ ALSO: 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention and 9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today . The narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings. In the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an “immediate action” to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15. “Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.” It also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face “arbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.” Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already “rightly restricted.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  ( see more details here ). Story Continues Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): Seen as an ‘Embodied AI Secular Winner’ Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On April 14, Deutsche Bank reiterated the stock as “Buy” and said that it’s sticking with the automaker. “We continue to view Tesla favorably longer term as an embodied AI secular winner but acknowledge it faces many cross currents for the next quarter or two.” Overall, TSLA ranks 7th on our list of AI stocks to watch amid market volatility. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

      "title": "Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey Call For Abolition Of All Intellectual Property Laws, Arguing There Are 'Much Greater Models To Pay Creators'",
      "content": "Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey Call For Abolition Of All Intellectual Property Laws, Arguing There Are 'Much Greater Models To Pay Creators' Namrata Sen April 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ), and Jack Dorsey , co-founder of Twitter (currently X) as well as Square, now called Block Inc. (NYSE: XYZ ), have ignited a debate over intellectual property rights. The tech magnates have suggested a complete eradication of IP laws, a move that has stirred controversy in the tech industry. What Happened : Dorsey initiated the discussion with a post on X stating, “delete all IP law.” Musk, who now owns X (formerly Twitter), promptly agreed with Dorsey’s sentiment. The discussion comes amid ongoing lawsuits faced by AI companies, including OpenAI, co-founded by Musk, over alleged copyright violations. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. The debate has drawn a mixed bag of reactions. Tech evangelist Chris Messina supported Dorsey’s stance. He wrote on BlueSky social, “Jack has a point\" as \"Automated IP fines/3-strike rules for AI infringement may become the substitute for putting poor people in jail for cannabis possession.\" Meanwhile, others, like Ed Newton-Rex of Fairly Trained , on BlueSky, criticized the interaction between the tech executives. “Tech execs declaring all-out war on creators who don't want their life's work pillaged for profit,” posted Newton-Rex. Why It Matters : The exchange of views between the tech innovators comes at a time when Meta Platforms ‘ (NASDAQ: META ) Llama AI models have been caught in a copyright lawsuit over the use of pirated e-books for training. Dorsey’s and Musk’s recent comments are in line with their long-held views on intellectual property rights. Dorsey has been a vocal critic of IP laws, viewing them as barriers to innovation. In his subsequent posts under the current one, he argued that the current IP system restricts creativity and unfairly benefits gatekeepers at the expense of creators. See Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. There are \"much greater models to pay creators\" while claiming \"the current ones take way too much from them and only rent-seek,” posted Dorsey. Similarly, Musk’s endorsement of Dorsey’s post is consistent with his 2014 Tesla patent pledge not to enforce patents against “good faith” users. However, in a twist of events, Tesla sued Australian company, Cap-XX in 2023, suspecting the supercapacitors used for energy storage in EV batteries likely infringed on two U.S. patents held by a Tesla subsidiary. Story Continues Their recent comments have reignited the conversation around intellectual property rights in the tech industry, a topic that will undoubtedly continue to be a point of contention.

      "title": "Should You Brace for Mag-7 ETFs Before It's Too Late?",
      "content": "Should You Brace for Mag-7 ETFs Before It's Too Late? Sanghamitra Saha April 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: NVDA MSFT TSLA The group of tech giants — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META — known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has been battered during the ongoing tariff turmoil. Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS has lost 5.9% past month (as of April 14, 2025). However, the group may see a turnaround once the first-quarter earnings season concludes, according to a note from Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham, as quoted on CNBC. The cluster of tech giants is slowly regaining investor attention. Following two years of explosive growth driven by the AI boom, these giants have cooled significantly, with valuations now falling to levels last seen before ChatGPT launched in late 2022. Cautious Outlook Despite Improved Trade Sentiment While the recent pause in retaliatory tariffs on electronics offers some relief, Graham believes the companies will still strike a cautious tone in their guidance. He noted that many of these firms are still vulnerable to potential regulatory retaliation. After all, the trade environment, though improved over the past week, is still volatile. However, the risk level for investors should significantly fall post Q1 earnings season as, by that time, we would have the companies’ rhetorics. Mag-7 Valuations Reset to Pre-AI Boom Levels Stock prices have come down considerably. Amazon’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, for example, is now at 32—down sharply from 86 on the day ChatGPT debuted. NVIDIA, long considered the top AI play, has also seen its P/E fall to 36 from the mid-50s. Other mega-cap tech names show similar trends. Apple trades at a 29 P/E, nearly back to its pre-AI rally level of 25. Alphabet is at 18, in line with late 2022, and Microsoft sits at 29, slightly above its previous 26. Only exceptions are Tesla and Meta. Tesla’s P/E ratio has surged to 119, well above its 2022 level of 70, while Meta Platforms trades at 23 compared to just 10 pre-AI. However, most of the Magnificent Seven remain deep in correction territory or the bear market. Recent Rally Suggests a Turning Point Last week saw a wave of bargain-hunting amid market volatility. The latest announcement of some kind of tariff exemptions to electronics imports may act as a major tailwind. While many are now interested in individual stock picking in the Mag-7 group (based on each company's individual strength and weakness), the group's core strengths remain intact: solid balance sheets, and enduring competitive advantages, per analysts. Story Continues Bottom Line No one underrates the opportunities in the -Mag-7 group. But the era of group-wide rallies appears to be over, replaced by more scrutinized stock selection and measured optimism. Despite more attractive valuations, investors are no longer treating the group as the pillar of Wall Street. The “Magnificent Seven” have probably fallen from grace. Stock performances within the group have diverged, due to factors such as new cheaper-cost AI entrants (e.g., DeepSeek) and individual companies’ ability to handle broader macro uncertainty (read: Will the Rise of DeepSeek Usher in a New AI Era? ETFs in Focus). . ETF Picks Microsoft and Alphabet shares have been less beaten down over the tumultuous past month. MSFT-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and Alphabet-heavy ETFs like Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF FCOM can be played. However, these ETFs also house other Mag-7 constituents. Due to the incessant chip demand, NVIDIA deserves a mention, and so does NVDA-heavy ETF Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC. And if you want to go for group-wide picks, you have options like MAGS, Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG and iShares S&P 100 ETF OEF to play on.

      "title": "Former Tesla supply chain leaders create Atomic, an AI inventory solution",
      "content": "Tesla famously struggled to scale up production of the Model 3 sedan in 2018 — so much so that CEO Elon Musk said his company was weeks away from collapsing . That near-death experience helped spawn a whole new company called Atomic that’s built around using AI to streamline supply chains. Co-founded by former Tesla employees Michael Rossiter and Neal Suidan, Atomic was created inside DVx Ventures, the firm run by former Tesla president Jon McNeill. Rossiter is also a partner at DVx, which has led a $3 million seed round for Atomic, with Seattle-based Madrona Ventures joining. “Michael and Neil experienced this pain firsthand as leaders at Tesla in the supply chain, and I saw that work firsthand — because they worked for me,” McNeill said in an interview with TechCrunch. Atomic plans to deploy its agentic AI with customers to make inventory planning faster and easier. It’s already been working with pilot customers. In one case, the customer was able to cut inventory levels in half while maintaining a 99% in-stock rate. Being able to strike a balance like that frees up working capital that a business can use in other places, while also reducing risk, McNeill said. “If you have too much capital tied up in inventory, you could really harm the business. And if you have too little, where you don’t have the right things in stock when the customer is ready to purchase, then you’re costing yourself big time,” he said. More broadly, Atomic’s early customers have been in the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, and apparel industries. The company claims it has helped those customers reduce inventory costs by 20% to 50%.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW With so much uncertainty in the world right now, there’s big demand for solutions like Atomic’s because existing ones aren’t built for this kind of volatility, Suidan said in an interview. Currently, “planners will, like, lock themselves in a room for a week trying to put together different scenarios, present those back to the leadership, and get a question they weren’t anticipating,” Suidan said. Then they “have to go back to these documents, spend a few days, and it’s becomes this process that can be all consuming for them, because they don’t have the tools available to manage the uncertainty with confidence.” Atomic’s software pulls information from those same source documents but lets inventory planners and supply chain team members quickly simulate multiple scenarios — something that would normally take hours or days. Rossiter and Suidan pride themselves on being able to get up and running with a customer quickly, and with adaptability. “You can’t be writing a custom application for every customer. You need a flexible data model that’s generalized, that can apply to everyone, because then you can be up and running really, really quickly,” Suidan said. “And you need to give precision control to the planner so that they feel true ownership over the plan, and they can explain it inside and out, and can pull all the levers in the plan. And if you can combine those two things, which has been our total focus, then you solve the problem for the planner.” Many Tesla employees have gone on to found their own startups, including former CTO JB Straubel (Redwood Materials) and, most recently, former SVP Drew Baglino ( Heron ). But Atomic is different. Instead of just taking skills learned at Tesla and applying them to new problems, Suidan and Rossiter are building Atomic around a philosophy they developed together at the automaker. “They built the end-to-end supply chain orchestration system from scratch” at Tesla, McNeill said. Suidan said the value of what they built at Tesla was just as much about the solution as it was changing the process. “The way the business was planned when we started was a dozen different teams working in isolation, passing these spreadsheets around, trying to tie it together once a week to present executives some summary of a plan, and then spending most of the rest of the week, chasing our tail, trying to figure out why one part didn’t work or the other part didn’t work,” Suidan said. “Our jobs became to build a system that could thrive and drive this company, keep its dynamism, keep its ability to hit these business targets.” Suidan said the planning system they built inside Tesla resulted in a “complete transformation” in the day-to-day operations. While Rossiter left Tesla shortly after the ramp-up of the Model 3, Suidan stuck around until 2022. In 2023 Suidan said the two put their heads together and asked: “How could this kind of transformation work for everybody, all businesses?” And they set out to create Atomic inside DVx. In typical Tesla fashion, they really are aiming that high. “Our ambition, our vision, is to support every company that sells physical goods,” Rossiter said.

      "title": "As Trump considers auto tariffs pause, parts exemptions could be key for US industry",
      "content": "As Trump considers auto tariffs pause, parts exemptions could be key for US industry Published: 2025-04-15 15:48:11 ET TSLA DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump hinted that he might temporarily relieve the auto industry from “permanent” tariffs he previously imposed on the business. The president didn't specify how long the potential pause would be or what it would entail, but the auto sector is awaiting how rules might change on 25% tariffs based on U.S. parts, if duties remain on assembled vehicles. Experts have said short pauses aren't likely to give carmakers enough of an opportunity to adjust their vast global supply chains, though parts exemptions would certainly bolster the industry amid Trump's trade war whiplash. Trump told reporters Monday that automakers “need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that,” referring to relocating production from Canada, Mexico and elsewhere. The news drove global auto stocks up Tuesday. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents domestic auto companies Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said in a statement: “There is increasing awareness that broad tariffs on parts could undermine our shared goal of building a thriving and growing American auto industry, and that many of these supply chain transitions will take time.” Trump first announced 25% automotive tariffs late March; the tariffs for completed vehicles took effect on April 3, while the parts tariffs were set to start 30 days later. “The one-month delay is intended to give the U.S. government time to work out rules to exempt the value of automotive parts that contains U.S.-made materials, which will not be subject to the tariffs,” according to insights from law firm Foley & Lardner, noting a “carveout” for parts certified under regional trade pact, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The Department of Commerce is expected to determine \"a system to calculate non-U.S. content” by May 3. At the same time, automakers are navigating steel and aluminum imports levies of at least 25%; 25% duties on all goods from Canada and Mexico; 10% global tariffs and reciprocal tariffs around the world — paused for 90 days, and both of which automotive is exempt from; and tariffs on China at 145%. Autos Drive America, which represents foreign automakers, said in a statement that “hitting pause on auto tariffs would be a step in the right direction and would allow automakers to deliver more choices at better prices for consumers.\" “Tariffs raise costs across the board — making it more expensive to build cars in America and harder for families to find the vehicle that fits their needs,” the group added. \"A pause on auto parts allows automakers to continue production in the U.S. without disruption while a pause on finished vehicles allows automakers to sell vehicles and keep investing in U.S. plants and jobs.” The United Auto Workers labor union did not respond to a request for comment. The on-again, off-again tariffs have already wrought havoc for any number of global sectors but especially the auto industry, which relies on a complex network of parts from around the world. Despite his close proximity to Trump through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has strayed from the president's views on tariffs. “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here,” Musk himself posted on his social media platform X. “The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.” Tesla's sold in the U.S. have a great deal of parts supplied and vehicles assembled here, and the company claims it has the “most American-made cars.” Varying trims of the Tesla Model Y and 3 are at least 85% domestic content, according to an annual Made in America auto index. For comparison, Ford builds about 80% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S. domestically. The American and European car industries are “severely affected by tariffs. On top of the 25% tariff imposed on vehicles, we are impacted by layer upon layer of additional compounding tariffs including those on aluminum, steel, and parts,” Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said in the company’s annual general meeting Tuesday, noting at the same time, the Chinese auto market’s potential for growth this year. “But it’s not too late if the U.S. and Europe take the necessary urgent actions to promote an orderly transition,” Elkann added. “We are encouraged by what President Trump indicated yesterday on tariffs for the car industry.” Though Trump says his tariffs are intended to bolster U.S. auto manufacturing, automakers aren't able to reconfigure their sourcing in short periods of time, experts say. Because of the nature of the business and the length of time it takes to design product and get manufacturing up and running, it could take years to reevaluate sources of supply and establish new assembly operations. “Flipping upside down a global supply chain that has been in place for decades cannot happen overnight for the auto industry,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note, “and we strongly believe the clear right move would be to focus on finished cars made in the U.S.” versus auto parts. The tariffs as they currently stand are sure to cost automakers billions of dollars, impact new and used vehicle supply and raise prices for car buyers at dealerships by thousands of dollars. Already, some auto manufacturers have paused operations in Canada and Mexico and temporarily laid off workers in the U.S. Some have also attempted to get ahead of the impact of tariffs through appeals to customers. In rare moves, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis began offering employee pricing programs for a limited time to reach buyers before what will most likely be steep price hikes. Hyundai and Genesis vowed to hold prices steady for the coming two months. Car buyers might be better positioned for an extra few weeks, depending on the latest policy change. A tariff exemption for the auto industry would be welcome relief to automakers and shoppers, said Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at car buying firm Edmunds. But as tariff policy fluctuates, it is difficult to know if exemptions will happen. “The best course of action for consumers actively shopping for their next car is to seek out any incentive programs or ‘protected pricing’ programs while they are available,” Yoon said. \"If your purchase timeline is a little further in the horizon, it may be prudent to await further clarification on tariff details and outcomes of potential exemptions instead of rushing into a purchase you may later regret.” ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Reports Next Week: What to Know Ahead of the Release",
      "content": "Tesla (TSLA) Reports Next Week: What to Know Ahead of the Release Zacks Equity Research April 15, 2025 4 min read In this article: TSLA Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Tesla (TSLA) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 22, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues are expected to be $21.85 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.12% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla? For Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -11.69%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of -2.67%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Tesla doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 45 cents per share and $21.85 billion, respectively. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings per share has declined 11 cents in the past 30 days. The estimate for the bottom line implies no change from the year-ago levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year uptick of 2.6%. In the last earnings season, the company missed earnings per share estimates. In the trailing four quarters, Tesla missed estimates thrice and beat once, with the average earnings surprise being 0.8%. Tesla, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tesla, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tesla, Inc. Quote Factors at Play Tesla delivered 336,681 cars (323,800 Model 3/Y and 12,881 other models) worldwide in the first quarter. This marked the lowest quarterly figure in more than two years. Sales were down from 495,570 units in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 386,810 in the first quarter of last year. The deliveries missed our estimate of 426,407 units. An obvious reason behind Tesla’s soft first-quarter 2025 deliveries was the fact that it had to retool its factories to produce the new version of its Model Y SUV. Also, CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement hasn’t worked in favor of Tesla’s brand image. The anti-Musk sentiment has hurt the company’s sales. Discounts and incentives are likely to have constrained automotive revenues and gross margins. We expect revenues from automotive sales to be $17.48 billion. Gross margins from automotive sales are expected at 15.8%, down 2 percentage points from the year-ago period. While the automotive segment is likely to be under pressure, Tesla is set to benefit from increasing energy generation and storage revenues, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 10.4 GWh of energy storage — a staggering 156% year-over-year increase. We expect revenues from the Energy Generation/Storage segment to be $2.1 billion, suggesting growth of 70% on a yearly basis. Our estimate for Services/Other unit is pegged at $2.5 billion, implying growth of 13% year over year. Meanwhile, continued investments for capacity expansion of not just vehicle factories but also supercharging network service, internal applications and battery processes are expected to have limited operating profits. Tesla’s capital expenditure has been consistently rising as the EV giant makes efforts to boost output capacity at its gigafactories, ramp up 4680 battery cell production, enhance the Supercharger infrastructure and develop AI-related technologies. Discouragingly, Tesla also expects its operating expenses to rise in 2025. High operating expenses are also likely to strain margins. Story Continues What Does Our Model Say? Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here. Earnings ESP : Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -11.7%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 5 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank : Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) Stock With the Favorable Combination While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Tesla, here are a few players from the auto space that, per our model, have the correct ingredients to post an earnings beat this time. QuantumScape QS will release first-quarter 2025 results on April 23. The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.07% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . The Zacks Consensus Estimate for QuantumScape’s to-be-reported quarter’s loss is pegged at 21 cents per share. QuantumScape surpassed earnings estimates in one of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other three occasions, with the average negative surprise being 7%. LKQ Corp. LKQ will release first-quarter 2025 results on April 24. The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.19% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 79 cents per share and $3.57 billion, respectively. LKQ surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters for as many misses, with the average negative surprise being 2.45%. BorgWarner BWA will release first-quarter 2025 results on May 7. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.24% and a Zacks Rank #3.

      "content": "Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy Now? Maham Fatima April 15, 2025 6 min read In this article: TSLA We recently published a list of the 10 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other machine-learning stocks. Grand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It’s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms. On April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there’s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek’s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward. Jassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors. Our Methodology We sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy Now? Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesl,a Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an EVs, and energy generation & storage systems company. Its Automotive segment offers EVs, supercharging, and vehicle insurance services. The Energy Generation and Storage segment designs, manufactures, and installs solar products. The company uses machine learning for autonomous driving, as well as for analyzing the data collected from its vast vehicle fleet. The company’s FSD and Optimus are currently driving its growth, with Optimus expected to generate over $10 trillion for the company in the long term. The unsupervised rollout of FSD is planned for June 2025 in the Austin, Texas facility. Wider US deployment is expected by the end of 2025. While internal Optimus rollout is planned for 2025, its external sales will begin in 2026. The company aims to increase production from 1000 units/month to 10,000 units/month after external sales begin. The cost will potentially come down to $20,000 or lower when the production capacity is 1 million units/year. On March 21, Morgan Stanley lowered the price target for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) from $430 to $410, while keeping an Overweight rating. Analysts think that despite falling short of anticipated performance, the company has an overarching thesis. They believe that the company’s transition from an automotive-focused business to a broader AI and robotics business is hurting its financials in the short run, but are setting the company up for growth potential ahead. Nightview Capital stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter , viewing the company as a leader in real-world AI: “Artificial intelligence is no longer just a promise—it’s becoming the defining force of the modern economy. From self-driving vehicles to humanoid robotics, intelligent systems are not only enhancing efficiency but unlocking entirely new markets. These systems process and learn from vast amounts of real-world data, iterating and improving at a scale no human could achieve. Overall, TSLA ranks 6th on our list of the best machine learning stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock .

      "content": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is a Trending Stock Zacks Equity Research April 15, 2025 5 min read In this article: TSLA Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this electric car maker have returned +6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.1%. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.5%. This estimate has changed -14.6% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.50 indicates a change of +31.8% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.1%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $21.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.6%. The $104.78 billion and $123.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.3% and +18.1%, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $25.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.2%. EPS of $0.73 for the same period compares with $0.71 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.53%. The EPS surprise was -2.67%. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Tesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Published April 15, 2025 By Kalena Thomhave post share post print email license A Ford Mustang Mach-E recharges at a Tesla Supercharger port. Honda is the latest automaker to gain access to Tesla's fast-charging technology. Courtesy of Ford Motor Co. Editor's note: This article was originally published in Automotive Dive, which has merged with WardsAuto to bring you expanded coverage of the industry. For the latest news, sign up for our free, daily newsletter . Drivers of the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX EVs will have access to Tesla’s Supercharger network in June. Honda is the latest to join a growing list of automakers gaining access to Tesla’s fast-charging technology, according to a March press release. Other EV makers with access to Tesla’s network include Volvo, Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Lucid, Nissan and Rivian. By the end of 2025, almost all major EV brands will have some access to Tesla’s expansive network, which has more than 25,000 DC fast-charging EV ports. Most automakers offer supercharger compatibility via adapters that allow their vehicles to use Tesla’s North American Charging Standard ports, though Hyundai’s 2025 Ioniq 5 comes with a NACS outlet, as will future Mercedes-Benz and Rivian vehicles. “Adding Tesla Supercharger network access to the charging networks already available to our EV customers means industry-leading fast-charging access for Honda and Acura EV drivers,” Ryan Harty, assistant vice president of sustainability and business development at the American arm of Honda, said in a statement. He said Honda’s goal by the end of the decade is to provide Honda and Acura EV drivers with access to the most convenient charging network in the country. The estimated 100,000 U.S. charge points include ports in the Tesla Supercharger network, the EVgo network, the Electrify America network and the new Ionna fast-charging network . Ionna is a joint venture among several automakers including Honda, BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota that launched its first charging station in February. Honda’s adapter for the Tesla Supercharger network was tested for safety and compatibility with the automaker’s EVs. The adapter will be available for purchase at Honda and Acura dealerships in June.

The company’s global sales fell by 13% year-on-year to 336,681 units in the first quarter of 2025, including a 9% drop in US sales to 128,100 units. The company’s share price has almost halved since Donald Trump won the US Presidential election in November. Naseem Akbarzada, Tesla country manager for Saudi Arabia, told reporters this week: “Today we are proud to officially launch in the kingdom, marking the start of a long-term presence in the country.” Tesla plans to build a network of charging stations for its customers, starting in the three cities where it has opened sales outlets. But recharging facilities on the country’s desert inter-city highways remains limited. Saudi economist Mohammed Al-Qahtani welcomed Tesla entry into the market, but urged the company to invest more in the country, saying “we do not want a showroom, we want a factory. We want to be part of the production process, not just consumption.” GlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?

      "content": "Down 47%, Is Tesla Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold in April? By Neil Patel – Apr 15, 2025 at 4:41AM Key Points Tesla's stock has performed exceptionally well in the past decade, but it remains very expensive. The company’s growth has come to a grinding halt with a less favorable economic environment. Elon Musk’s long-term dreams of a robotaxi service remain, but the outcome is uncertain. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.36 %) $ 15.10 Current Price $ 433.88 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Investors who got in on Tesla ( TSLA 3.36% ) early have been handsomely rewarded, to put it lightly. A $1,000 investment in this electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy business 10 years ago would be worth an eye-popping $17,920 today. This translates to an unbelievable 1,690% return, turning this into one of the world's most valuable and influential companies. It hasn't been a smooth ride, though, as the past several months indicate. As of April 11, this top EV stock is trading 47% below its record from December of last year, propelled by a huge loss in 2025. Is Tesla a buy, sell, or hold in April? Not behaving like a tech enterprise Highly successful tech companies are known for their disruptive products and services and a culture of innovation. Monster growth is also usually part of the story. For much of its history, Tesla fit the bill. Its revenue and EV production volume shot up over the past decade as its models became popular among consumers interested in beautiful designs and cool tech features. But Tesla is starting to resemble a typical auto manufacturer. And that's not a good thing. For starters, it's more susceptible to competitive forces. Tesla's impressive success encouraged rivals to work on their own EVs. Nowadays, consumers face no shortage of choices. Tesla also isn't immune to changing macro forces . It benefited greatly from a low-interest-rate environment for most of the 2010s. This is no longer the case. Higher borrowing costs and ongoing economic uncertainty can be discouraging for people who want to buy cars. As a result, Tesla has engaged in price wars to support demand. This hurts financials. Growth has slowed, with automotive revenue down 6% in 2024. Profitability is taking a hit, with gross and operating margins contracting compared to 2023. Longtime Tesla bulls aren't used to seeing this. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.36 %) $ -15.10 Current Price $ 433.88 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.19 - $ 451.67 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 4.1M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A Uncertainty around the future Tesla shares might be driving in the wrong direction. However, the valuation says something totally different. The stock still sells at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of 123.5. While this multiple is down from a few years ago, it undoubtedly highlights the market's unwavering bullishness toward the business. In other words, Tesla is a story stock . Narratives have a major impact. And CEO Elon Musk continues to emphasize the future of this business, one in which full self-driving (FSD) is the focal point of operations. Musk has repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered on the timeline for FSD tech. To his and Tesla's credit, the company is set to launch a robotaxi service in Texas this June. That's a start. The ultimate goal for Tesla is to introduce a global robotaxi service that can replace car ownership for many people, sees virtually unlimited demand, and generates a massive stream of high-margin revenue. Like Uber , in this vision, Tesla would have its own app or platform that connects riders with cars, but at a much lower cost and much more safely. No one has any clue when or if this will happen. Notable challenges remain to achieve true FSD capabilities. Management will need to address regulatory developments, consumer trust, and technology advancements. I can certainly understand why investors remain bullish, wanting to buy or hold shares. This continues to be a disruptive company, and shares trade well below their record. My view is different. The stock is richly valued and prices in flawless execution in an uncertain future. Prospective investors should steer clear, and existing shareholders should sell.

      "content": "Man arrested in arson attacks targeting Tesla, GOP office in Albuquerque Published: 2025-04-15 04:57:07 ET TSLA Federal authorities have arrested and charged a 40-year-old man in connection with arson attacks at an Albuquerque Tesla dealership and the office of the Republican Party of New Mexico. The suspect, Jamison Wagner, has been charged with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives and faces between five and 20 years in prison for each count if convicted, the Justice Department announced Monday in a statement. Wagner was arrested Saturday by agents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that evidence recovered suggests that they may have prevented further attacks. \"Amazing work from our teams, ATF colleagues, and regional law enforcement partners executing the mission,\" Patel said. \"This is part of our FBI mandate to locate those responsible for the domestic terrorist attacks on Tesla and promptly bring them to justice.\" According to the criminal complaint, a fire erupted at a Tesla Albuquerque showroom early on Feb. 9. Officers arrived at the scene to find significant evidence of vandalism. Two Tesla cars parked outside the showroom were damaged, including one significantly, by fire. Upwards of 11 vehicles were spray-painted as were exterior walls of the facility with phrases such as \"Die Elon\" and \"Tesla Nazi Inc.,\" the document states. A device containing a gelatinous substance -- later identified by the ATF forensic laboratory as improvised napalm -- was found in one of the damaged vehicles. The attack was captured by surveillance cameras. Then on March 30, shortly before 6 a.m., a fire was reported at the Republican Party of New Mexico office. The fire damaged the front door and entry area. Responding authorities also found \"ICE=KKK\" spray-painted on one of the building's exterior walls. \"A fire scene examination was conducted, and based upon the data collected during the examination, an ATF Fire Investigator classified the fire as incendiary, meaning an intentional human act,\" the complaint states. The ensuing investigation determined that both crimes involved homemade incendiary devices using glass containers and flammable liquids. The investigators were also able to determine that Wanger was a person of interest in both crimes due to surveillance footage retrieved from the scenes and the fact that he owns a white 2015 Hyundai Accent, a vehicle a suspect had been seen exiting before attacking the Republican Party building and returning to before fleeing. \"Let this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"We will arrest you, we will prosecute you and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.\" Tesla has become a target of anger for opponents of the Trump administration and Elon Musk, the CEO of U.S. automaker. After backing Trump's election campaign with hundreds of millions of dollars, Musk was appointed to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with eliminating waste and fraud from the federal government, often through mass firings. Though there have been nonviolent protests at Tesla dealerships, they have also been the target for violent vandalism, which prompted Bondi last month to describe the attacks as \"domestic terrorism.\" Copyright 2025 United Press International, Inc.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN ). What happened: A report published by TechCrunch shared that the company is backed by Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder Jeff Bezos. The report said that Slate Auto has brought in people from the likes of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ), Harley-Davidson Inc. (NYSE: HOG ), and General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM ). Slate Auto has set a target of developing a “cheap” $25,000 single-cab EV truck, and plans to enter the production phase by late 2026. Don’t Miss: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. As news of the Bezos-backed startup hit the wires, a post on social media platform Reddit in the r/whatisthiscar subreddit surfaced, which showcased what looked like a small EV truck in dark grey being transported on a flatbed truck. The truck features round headlights, upright B-pillars, and steel wheels. What is this car? by u/discostranger09 in whatisthiscar It was later confirmed that the truck was Slate Auto's concept car. According to the report, the company is looking to manufacture its vehicles in a plant in Indianapolis, Indiana. The design of Slate Auto's concept car is somewhat reminiscent of the old-school Ford Ranger. See Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. Why it matters: The news comes in at a time when the US auto sector is dealing with a 25% import tariff levied by the Donald Trump administration, much to the criticism of stakeholders within the auto industry. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney forecasts a difficult period for the auto sector in the U.S. due to the tariffs. Delaney pointed out that Rivian may face risks from reduced U.S. EV policy support. EV trucks in the U.S. from the likes of Tesla, GM, Ford, and Rivian currently retail in the approximate price range of $47,000 – $105,000. However, a cheap EV truck would certainly broaden the sector's appeal and could potentially disrupt the segment as well. EV companies are looking to release cheaper variants of their EV trucks in a bid to broaden the product’s appeal, with Tesla most recently releasing an RWD, long-range variant of its Cybertruck.

Chinese users visiting Tesla's website and WeChat mini program on Friday found both models unavailable, according to checks by Reuters. The move came after China slapped a 125% tariff on U.S.-made cars, responding to President Donald Trump's decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145%. Tesla didn't offer an explanation and didn't respond to a request for comment. Both models are built in the United States and shipped to China. But they play a minor role in Tesla's business there just 1,553 Model X and 311 Model S units were imported in 2024, making up less than 0.5% of the company's global deliveries, which topped 657,000 last year. Most of Tesla's success in China rides on its Shanghai-made Model 3 and Model Y, which dominate local sales and are also exported to Europe. That production base has helped the company avoid some of the trade crossfire hitting other automakers. Still, Tesla isn't immune. It's feeling the heat from domestic rivals like BYD ( BYDDY , Financials ), which continue to grab market share. Deliveries of Tesla's premium lineup the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck dropped 25% globally in the first quarter. Analysts point to the lack of updates and growing backlash over CEO Elon Musk's political presence. With tariffs rising and competition intensifying, Tesla's China strategy is facing some serious roadblocks and the timing couldn't be worse. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

      "content": "Why Tesla, GM, and Rivian will be hurt most by China's critical minerals export ban Critical rare earth minerals are used in motors for EVs and other parts needed for US auto assembly. Pras Subramanian · Senior Reporter Updated April 14, 2025 3 min read In this article: GM RIVN TSLA F China’s suspension of critical rare earth minerals exports to the US could become a major headache for US companies, particularly automakers like Tesla ( TSLA ), GM ( GM ), and Rivian ( RIVN ). Per the New York Times and Reuters , China ordered restrictions on exports of six rare earth metals that are only refined within the country on April 4. The metals, along with rare earth magnets, are used in everything from autos to aerospace products, with rare earth metals in particular used in magnets for EV motors. The suspension comes after President Trump ratcheted up his trade war with China with enhanced tariffs on April 2. Many of the metal shipments are stuck at ports in China, awaiting new instructions from the Chinese government on the special export permit process needed to ship the materials out. Currently no guidance is in place, per the reports. Rare earth mine in Baiyun'ebo or Bayan Obo, a mining town in Inner Mongolia in China. The mines north of town are one the largest deposits of rare earth metals found in the world. (Bert van Dijk via Getty Images) · Bert van Dijk via Getty Images China produces 99% of the world’s supply of rare earth minerals and 90% of the rare earth magnets. “It is important to be aware that there is a big difference between China requiring export licenses as compared to a ban on exports. China has announced export license requirements on critical minerals before but in many cases there weren’t any actual signs of declining import volumes,” countered Daniel Pickard, chair of the International Trade practice at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC, to Yahoo Finance. Pickard is also chair of the critical minerals advisory committee for the Office of the US Trade Representative. Pickard also believes China's move is more of a \"political message\" and that exports may not actually decrease. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents several automakers on trade and industry-related issues, did not immediately respond for comment. “China’s ban on rare earth exports to the US slows access to a number of minerals crucial to modern vehicle production,” said manufacturing expert Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions to Yahoo Finance. “Minerals such as yttrium and dysprosium are important for electric vehicle manufacturing as key ingredients for batteries and motors. Other minerals could slow production of smaller motors, speakers, camera lenses, and LEDs,” which are used in auto production as well. Reuters reported that several Chinese rare earth sellers have declared force majeure (a legal term that means \"superior force\") on their contracts with overseas buyers, meaning they claim they cannot fulfill their commitments due to forces outside their control. Top US EV manufacturers like Tesla, GM, Rivian, and Ford ( F ) are deeply exposed, as they assemble many motors for their vehicles in the US. Conversely, rivals like European, Japanese, and, to a lesser extent, Chinese manufacturers will benefit from their access to these important resources only available from China. Story Continues Tesla has cut its use of rare earth metals in its motors by 25% and intends for its next-generation EVs to be rare-earth free. GM said it is \"exploring options to limit or potentially eliminate rare earth materials in EV motors\" but did not provide a timetable. Even if the US automakers are able to acquire these materials from other parts of the world (though in diminished quantities), they will likely have to pay up for it. “These already expensive materials will only increase in cost with China removed as a potential source where they currently provide around half of the world’s supply of some rare earth minerals. Turning to other countries, where their production costs are already higher, will increase prices for manufacturers of many electric vehicle components,” Fiorani said.

      "content": "Justice Department charges man with arson at New Mexico Tesla dealership and GOP headquarters Published: 2025-04-14 14:56:08 ET TSLA WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has charged a man with vandalizing a Tesla dealership in New Mexico and setting fire to the headquarters of the state Republican Party, according to court records unsealed Monday. A criminal complaint charges Jamison R. Wagner, 40, with federal arson charges in connection with the vandalism in February at a Tesla showroom in Bernalillo, where authorities found two Tesla Model Y vehicles ablaze as well as spray-painted graffiti messages including “Die Elon\" and “Die Tesla Nazi.” Elon Musk is the billionaire CEO of Tesla and a close ally of President Donald Trump who has helped engineer a massive downsizing of the federal government and purge of employees. The arrest is part of a federal crackdown on what the attorney general has described as a wave of domestic terrorism against property carrying the logo of Musk’s electric-car company. Attorney General Pam Bondi previewed the arrest Thursday during a Cabinet meeting to highlight federal law enforcements' efforts to go after vandals in recent weeks targeting the electric-car company. Wagner is also charged in connection with a fire last month at the Albuquerque headquarters of the New Mexico Republican Party. The fire badly burned the entrance and caused extensive smoke damage throughout the office, authorities said. Republican representatives also found spray paint on the side of the building about 50 feet (15 meters) from the entrance, saying “ICE=KKK,” according to New Mexico Republican Party Chair Amy Barela. During a search of Wagner’s home and garage, investigators found eight assembled suspected incendiary devices, black and red spray paint and a cardboard stencil with the phrase “ICE=KKK” that had red spray paint on it, according to court papers. An attorney for Wagner didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department has charged four other cases against people accused of using Molotov cocktails to destroy Tesla cars and fire stations. The FBI last month created a task force to coordinate investigate efforts around the attacks with officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Bondi has suggested prosecutors will make no plea deals with those charged in the Tesla attacks, telling the president at the White House Thursday that “there will be no negotiations, at your directive.” Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Moreover, TSLA does \"not necessarily have the most exposure to international\" catalysts, Tsilis added. An economist who worked for CME Group in the past, Tsilis was also a Financial Advisor for BMO, a Canadian bank. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): AI Vision Versus EV Weakness - Goldman Balances Long-Term Hopes with Near-Term Risks More of Tsilis' Comments on TSLA Since Tesla produces many of its EVs domestically, it may not have the most exposure among Big Tech names to overseas markets, Tsilis stated. However, he added that the automaker could be affected by issues that impact its supply chains. Nonetheless, the company's shares have been relatively durable over the past \"couple of weeks,\" he stated. \"Tesla was the biggest political gainer (earlier in the year), and then it was \"the biggest political loser,\" he noted. Tsilis' Macro View \"The market is trying to carve out a bottom,\" Tsilis believes. The commentator thinks that China will eventually make concessions to the U.S., enabling semiconductor makers, such as Nvidia (NVDA), to advance. And if the tariff issue is resolved favorably, according to large investors, the overall \"appetite for risk taking\" will increase, according to Tsilis. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

A lot of that decline, some say, ties back to Elon Musk's political activity, which has made some investors uneasy. But Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg sees the pullback as an overreaction. In his view, the challenges from new tariffs to tough competition and an aging model lineup are short-term issues, not signs of deeper trouble.Legg points to a few reasons he's still bullish. Tesla is launching a new model in the second quarter, and its long-awaited robotaxi service is finally set to begin in Austin this June. Even if it starts small, he thinks it could expand quickly. He's also watching Tesla's push into robotics through the Optimus project, which could eventually shift the company beyond carmaking.While Legg lowered his 12-month price target from $475 to $350, he still sees upside around 39% from here. And with Tesla's production focused in North America, it may dodge some of the tariff hit others are facing. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

Tesla's Tumble Nears Its End, Benchmark Analyst Foresees Rebound Ahead Shares have dropped 47% amid a mix of political and operational setbacks. Legg attributes the slump to political blowback from CEO Elon Musk's growing involvement in U.S. politics, along with broader headwinds, including soft first-quarter sales, regulatory uncertainty, and rising competition in the electric vehicle space. He also pointed to an aging product lineup and delays in new model releases as weighing on investor sentiment. However, Legg emphasized that many of these challenges appear temporary. As the year progresses, we believe political overhang could ease, and Tesla's longer-term opportunity remains intact, he said. He added that speculation over Musk's diminishing influence in the new U.S. administration may help ease brand tensions and bring back sidelined investors.

      "title": "2 High-Growth Electric Vehicle (EV) Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Not Tesla)",
      "content": "2 High-Growth Electric Vehicle (EV) Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Not Tesla) By Ryan Vanzo – Apr 14, 2025 at 8:05AM Key Points Tesla shares have performed incredibly over the long term. These two EV stocks are trying to replicate this success. NASDAQ : RIVN Rivian Automotive Market Cap $16B Today's Change angle-down ( -0.84 %) $ 0.11 Current Price $ 12.98 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) has been one of the best investments of all time. Since 2010, shares have increased in value by more than 19,000%. Even a small initial investment could have turned into a fortune for investors who held on throughout the volatility. With a market cap of nearly $800 billion, Tesla's biggest days of growth are arguably behind it. This reality has caused investors to search for the next Tesla capable of producing huge gains. If you're also on the lookout for the next Tesla, the two electric vehicle (EV) stocks below should top your watchlist. Expand NASDAQ : RIVN Rivian Automotive Today's Change ( -0.84 %) $ -0.11 Current Price $ 12.98 Key Data Points Market Cap $16B Day's Range $ 12.94 - $ 13.27 52wk Range $ 9.50 - $ 17.15 Volume 28M Avg Vol 44M Gross Margin -988.16 % Dividend Yield N/A My favorite electric car stock for 2025 This year, my top pick among EV stocks is Rivian ( RIVN 0.84% ) . When you compare Rivian's growth prospects with its valuation, the risk-reward trade-off looks very appealing. But there's a catch. With only two high-end luxury models in its lineup -- the R1T and R1S, both of which can cost upwards of $100,000 with certain options -- Rivian's total addressable market is fairly limited. Most car buyers simply can't afford its vehicles. And since both vehicles have been on the market for a number of years, most early adopters already own one. This has caused Rivian's sales growth to plateau. Next quarter, analysts expect sales to decrease by around 17.5%. The competition, meanwhile, is expected to grow sales next quarter by double-digit rates. Fortunately, Rivian stock is appropriately priced for this reality. At 2.3 times sales, Rivian trades at a sizable discount to the competition. Yet, in 2026, sales growth should pick up considerably with the launch of three mass market models, all of which should be priced under $50,000, dramatically increasing Rivian's potential sales base. This is the catch with Rivian stock right now. Shares are undeniably cheap, but near term results are expected to be very poor. But if you're willing to look past 2025, Rivian's prospects should improve considerably. Expect plenty of volatility, but Rivian's valuation today is almost too good to pass up, as long as you're willing to commit to a holding period of several years. This EV stock can produce gigantic returns Want even bigger growth potential than Rivian? Check out Lucid Group ( LCID 0.99% ) . There's more risk to this story, but the greater upside arguably makes up for that fact. Lucid has a significantly higher valuation than Rivian, with shares trading at 7.7 times sales. But its near-term growth expectations are also significantly higher. This quarter, revenue is expected to jump by more than 50%. That's largely the result of its new Gravity SUV platform being shipped to new customers. This is Lucid's second major model introduction, with the potential to more than double sales over time. Like Rivian, Lucid plans on releasing three new affordable models, with production expected to begin sometime in 2026. But Lucid isn't as well financed, with just $1.6 billion in cash on the books versus $5.3 billion for Rivian. Plus, Lucid's longtime CEO recently stepped down, adding more uncertainty to previously established production timelines. I prefer Rivian over Lucid due to its more visible runway to releasing affordable mass market models. But with a market cap of just $8 billion, Lucid arguably has more raw upside potential.

      "content": "The bond market is headed for a crisis Brian Sozzi · Executive Editor April 14, 2025 In this video: NVDA TSLA COPX You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , YouTube , or wherever you get your podcasts. While a lot of attention has been focused on the volatile stock market, investing pros say it’s time to shift more focus to the bond market. Indeed the market is undergoing its own major convulsions amid Trump tariff concerns, which is rattling many investors around the world. Of note is that as stock prices have sold off, bond prices have sold off too. That despite Treasurys often being viewed as a place of safety during stock market turbulence. The moves in the bond market are sending signals that the US may have trouble paying its future debts and could fall into a recession soon. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with bond market expert and founder of The Bear Traps Report Lawrence McDonald to get his thoughts on the high-stakes situation. McDonald says a Lehman Brothers-like moment may be coming to markets. He adds there are other ways to invest in Nvidia ( NVDA ) besides investing in Nvidia, suggesting metals stocks or the hard assets themselves. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid is produced by Langston Sessoms Video Transcript 0:05 spk_0 Welcome to a new episode of Opening bid. I'm Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sai. Like I always say, this is the podcast that will make you a smarter investor, period. Let's put up one minute on the clock, our shot clock, uh, stock of the day going Best Buy on this news that President Trump or the Trump administration will exempt smartphones, computers, and certain electronics from those China Towers.And there was just this massive relief. Suddenly companies like Apple are going to do amazingly in terms of financials, but when you dig beneath the results, the 20% tariff is still in place here. So I want to lock in on Best Buy because when I originally heard this news, I'm like, right, Best Buy is years gonna be saved. This is great, rah rah. Best Buy, no, that's not the case. And here are some numbers here from the folks at Citi.So the 20% China tariff is still in place. That means a lot of products that Best Buy sells smartphones, electronics, computers will still be hit by that tariff. City estimating Best Buy could see a 15% product cost inflation hit, almost 1000 basis point hit to gross profit margins this year because of that 20% tariff, assuming there's no mitigating factors. To me that spells not a good financial.Holiday season for a company like Best Buy and I'm out of time. That's all I got on Best Buy. All right, let's, uh, continue to drill, drill into markets here. Special guest Larry McDonald, author, the bear traps report founder, good to see you in person. I know you're you're traveling the world, so good to see you in Times Square at the NASDAQ. 1:28 spk_1 Yeah, it's been a good run. I mean, the book, our book came out and the main thesis of the book How to Listen to Market Speak. Great book this, um.Multi-polar world that drives a colossal migration of capital and that's what kind of played out last week. 1:46 spk_0 You were the, you were thebond guy and holy cow, we have seen some major moves in the bond market. The 10 year up to 4.5%. I thought when stocks sold off you go into treasuries, but that's not working. Why? 2:00 spk_1 OK, for the last 40 years, you're right, whenever we go risk off, so down in stocks, bonds have gone up.And it has a lot to do with the flight equality, United States of America and trust, and there's two elements of trust that are broken. Let's Congress broke the back of the trust around the debt, so $37 trillion of debt, but that's up 11 trillion in the last 4 years, right? So and global investors were already a little sick to their stomach of, you know, with the United States and that amount of debt, but then Trump came along with a sledgehammer and said we're gonna change the world order on trade, right?So if you're a European investor for the last like 30 years you've just loved the United States, love the United States most of the time. Now when I spoke last week to European investors, they're losing money on their stocks, they're losing money on their bonds and the foreign exchange. So if you own US stocks in.In, uh, in any kind of euro or any kind of currency in Europe, uh, you're losing money on the currency as well, so they're not happy clients now, and so what that's doing is it takes imagine a whitewater river of incoming cash coming into the United States just violently reversing and going the other way. That's what's happening. 3:11 spk_0 What'sthe, what's the signal that the bond market is sending you? 3:15 spk_1 Uh, just signaling, uh, a lack of trust in the sense that that world order that we've had is, is changing first of all, and what we make the point in the book how to listen to market speak is this great migration of capital. If there's that much uncertainty in bonds, which for the bedrock, then we should see capital move from financial assets which are financial assets all it means is paper certificates, bonds and stocks. It's paper.Uh, we should move over toward hard assets which we just kind of see over the last year. Silver is outperforming the NASDAQ. Gold's outperforming the Nasdaq by like 30, 30%, and 3:51 spk_0 that's not the normhere. I mean, investors have been trained the past 10 years. Stocks like Nvidia and Apple go up in a straight line and maybe on like 2% of your portfolio ingold or maybe 1%. 4:01 spk_1 Newmont Mining up $15 last week, and this is the stock that Buffett bought years ago, Buffett's team.So, uh, yeah, it's not like we're, that's all that's not the only place to be, but companies that own assets in the ground, whether it be natural gas, whether it be, uh, platinum palladium, I mean there's so many, there's so many metals that are strategic for just this whole AI revolution.I mean, I think we're gonna have a copper crisis in 2026-2027 where the amount of copper needed for the Ukraine rebuild, right, for the Gaza rebuild for artificial intelligence, for robotics, supposedly all these robots are gonna replace human beings.They all need metal. They all need copper and and strategic metals, and that's where the real moneys can be made. The old portfolio was your 60/40 stock bonds belong a lot of growth stocks. That was like 2010 to 2020 portfolio. That's history.The new portfolio that we line up in the book is a portfolio of kind of harder harder harder hard asset companies. 5:05 spk_0 Ifis the bond market suggesting that the bond market losing trust in the US credit worthiness and how big a deal isthat? 5:17 spk_1 It's enormous now it's, it can be won back um through deficit reduction and through taxation.And it's people, people forget all tariffs are is taxes, so a tariff is just a tax on global investors. 5:32 spk_0 I just got hit with145%tax. 5:34 spk_1 Yeah. Now Americans do pay if you wanna if you wanna buy, buy an iPhone, you're gonna pay a higher tax, right? But a lot.Uh, the, the thing about tariffs is global companies and global countries are also sharing that tax so we can to get out of this debt hole we can raise taxes on global companies, global investors, US, US citizens, or we can default. I mean, interest on the debt is $1 trillion a year, right? That's 25% of tax receipts, 20% of tax receipts, and the rest, the rest of the developed world is only like.So the rest of the developed world in terms of interest, annual interest cost versus their tax receipts, the rest of the developed worlds like in the 234 to 6% group. 6:17 spk_0 I caught a post from you on X. I don't know where you were, but you were breaking down the stress we're seeing in the bond market and you dropped Lehman and you lived and managed. That's the first time I came in contact with your work, uh, during the, "

      "title": "Reincorporating A Delaware Entity Elsewhere: Could This Be The Next Great DExodus?",
      "content": "Reincorporating A Delaware Entity Elsewhere: Could This Be The Next Great DExodus? Published: 2025-04-14 10:11:11 ET TSLA Amidst a flurry of recent reincorporations—conveniently coined \"DExits\"—of major corporations such as Dropbox, Tesla, and potentially Meta, Delaware's future as a corporate safe-haven faces uncertainty. Delaware has long been the state of incorporation for the largest number of limited liability companies and corporations out of any other state. With more than 60% of Fortune 500 Companies and well over 1 million registered companies, Delaware paved its way to a business-friendly reputation by establishing the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\") and the Court of Chancery, a court of equity dedicated solely to business disputes, -an offering other states have tried but failed to perfect. Such a system has developed a complex and rich body of case law, which in theory provides predictability to companies and their investors. In recent years, however, tech companies have begun an exodus of sorts, reincorporating in and moving operations to states including Nevada, Texas, and Wyoming. The idea of relocating became a topic of discussion when a Delaware court decision invalidated Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package from SpaceX. In response, Musk reincorporated SpaceX in Texas in an effort to allow his compensation plan to proceed. Shortly after, other companies began questioning the status quo of Delaware as the most business-friendly state. Musk's subsequent reincorporation of Tesla in Texas intensified conversations around reincorporation outside Delaware. Moreover, the Delaware Courts were hit with criticisms stating that judges were incorporating politics and creative writing into their work, therefore undermining the state's previously predictable corporate law precedents. Criticisms were amplified when the Court of Chancery initially disallowed TripAdvisor from reincorporating in Nevada. The Court said that a reincorporation for the public company required approval from a special committee within the company and that making such a decision would deprive certain shareholders of their litigation rights. Similarly, a Delaware judge voided an Activision Blizzard merger because one shareholder filed suit on the grounds that the merger process violated the technical requirements of the DGCL, despite the company obtaining 98% shareholder approval. These decisions indicated an increased likelihood that reincorporation actions could lead to expensive litigation in Delaware. Corporations shouldn't write Delaware off just yet, though. In 2025, the Supreme Court of Delaware overturned the Chancery Court's Activision Blizzard decision, stating that the business judgment rule—a standard of review known for being deferential to business leaders and decisionmakers—should have been applied, rather than the \"entire fairness\" standard of review. This decision provides some reassurance that the Delaware Supreme Court trusts business leaders to make decisions as basic as where to incorporate; however, the backdrop of shareholder activists pursuing litigation and a plaintiff's bar seeking windfalls only increases the likelihood of litigation surrounding reincorporation. These risks alone may be enough to make corporations want to avoid the Delaware environment altogether and seek greener, less litigious pastures elsewhere. This fact is especially true where said pastures are claiming to offer fewer regulatory constraints, relaxed governance laws, and the ability for companies to have greater autonomy. Nevada, for example, has a controlling shareholder anti-takeover statute that aims to protect a company from potential meritless litigation or hostile takeovers without having to consciously enact measures such as \"poison-pill\" shareholder plans. Wyoming does not collect entity ownership information and allows a trust to hold a Wyoming-registered LLC, creating a thicker-than-usual veil of secrecy. In comparison, Delaware merely refrains from disclosing the name of directors and officers in public filings, but those fiduciaries can often be found with some digging. Additionally, a Nevada Supreme Court ruling in the landmark case Chur v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. of Nev. held that grossly negligent or reckless actions may not violate the duty of care owed to the company or its shareholders. This stands in contrast to the Delaware standard by which it must be proven that directors or officers acted in bad faith or were grossly negligent. Both Delaware and Texas take a similar approach to fiduciary duties for directors and officers, with both having implemented standards for fiduciaries' duties of care and loyalty through case law. Texas' standards regarding these duties are in their infancy but will eventually make their way into a court, arguably making Texas case law vulnerable to the same alleged \"creative writing\" accusations of Delaware's judges. Texas' standards differ from Nevada's, where the fiduciary duties of directors and officers are codified in statute, with the aim of providing less room for judicial interpretation. However, Texas law also establishes the fiduciary duty of obedience—directors and officers cannot exceed the scope of what the corporation is permitted to do under its governing documents and any other limits set out under state law. But are these other states offering enough to warrant dismantling the century-old history of incorporation in Delaware? Is the legal uncertainty worth venturing into the wild west of corporate governance?? Time has yet to tell. It will likely be many years before the more defined state statutes are tested by each state's respective courts—courts that do not have as much expertise with complex corporate litigation. Depending on which court a company may find itself in outside of Delaware, a handful of different, unpredictable outcomes may be had. When it comes to corporate governance, every Board should be acting by the books, and should an action be challenged, the company will want to understand the ideally predictable case law by which it will be judged. From simple procedural matters to complex litigation backed by minimal case law, these compounding unknowns have inspired many company leaders to disregard the recent reincorporation trend and remain in the hands of their familiar state, Delaware. The fact that Delaware has no state sales tax and no taxes on intangible assets is an added bonus. Despite the temptation that may come with a lack of franchise tax in Nevada, the franchise taxes in Delaware are often predictable, and even so, the Delaware tax may not pose much of an issue for smaller companies, but rather is more financially and administratively burdensome for larger, more complex businesses. Even Texas implements franchise taxes that are a percentage of annual revenue, which for an emerging company could be as little as nothing, but for an entity like Tesla, could be exorbitant. Another notable tax consideration is the fact that neither Texas nor Nevada implements state corporate income taxes. However, it's worth understanding that Nevada and Texas implement variable gross receipts taxes based on business activity and sales amounts, which in practice, may create tax implications similar to those resulting from a formal income tax. In response to all the commotion, Delaware released an announcement on February 17, 2025, regarding its intent to pass a legislative response to the corporate departures and other uncertainties. Topics of note include plaintiff's award fee limits, the status and rights of controlling stockholders, and director independence. With a patchwork of caselaw pointing corporate leaders and legal teams in different directions, the Delaware state legislature hopes to set a clearer standard for the controlling stockholder characterization. This standard increases the ownership percentage threshold that allows a shareholder to exercise control, dictates"

It’s returned 441% since April 2020, blowing past the S&P 500’s 90.9% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 16.8%. Is now the time to buy Tesla, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it’s free . We’re glad investors have benefited from the price increase, but we don't have much confidence in Tesla. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with TSLA and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Tesla Not Exciting? Originally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. 1. Low Gross Margin Reveals Weak Structural Profitability For industrials businesses, cost of sales is usually comprised of the direct labor, raw materials, and supplies needed to offer a product or service. These costs can be impacted by inflation and supply chain dynamics in the short term and a company’s purchasing power and scale over the long term. Tesla has bad unit economics for an industrials business, signaling it operates in a competitive market. This is also because it’s an automobile manufacturer. Automobile manufacturers have structurally lower profitability as they often break even on the initial sale of vehicles and instead make money on parts and servicing, which come many years later - this explains why new entrants such as Rivian and Lucid have negative gross margins. As you can see below, these dynamics culminated in an average 21.1% gross margin for Tesla over the last five years. Tesla Trailing 12-Month Gross Margin 2. EPS Took a Dip Over the Last Two Years While long-term earnings trends give us the big picture, we also track EPS over a shorter period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. Sadly for Tesla, its EPS declined by 22.9% annually over the last two years while its revenue grew by 9.5%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Tesla Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) 3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. As you can see below, Tesla’s margin dropped by 5.2 percentage points over the last five years. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle as it pursues new AI technologies such as a robotaxi or humanoid robot fleet. Tesla’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 3.7%. Story Continues Tesla Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Final Judgment Tesla isn’t a terrible business, but it doesn’t pass our quality test. With its shares beating the market recently, the stock trades at 77.7× forward price-to-earnings (or $255.91 per share). At this valuation, there’s a lot of good news priced in - you can find better investment opportunities elsewhere. Let us point you toward an all-weather company that owns household favorite Taco Bell . Stocks We Would Buy Instead of Tesla The market surged in 2024 and reached record highs after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, but questions about new economic policies are adding much uncertainty for 2025. While the crowd speculates what might happen next, we’re homing in on the companies that can succeed regardless of the political or macroeconomic environment. Put yourself in the driver’s seat and build a durable portfolio by checking out our Top 6 Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.

      "content": "Warren Buffett Bought This Electric Vehicle (EV) Stock in 2008. Even After a 2,000% Return, It's Still a Buy in 2025. (Hint: It's Not Tesla.) By Adam Levy – Apr 14, 2025 at 4:14AM Key Points Charlie Munger convinced Warren Buffett to buy a 10% stake in Chinese automaker BYD before it produced its first all-electric car. After treading water for a decade, the automaker is growing quickly and taking market share. Investors can buy the stock for a great price today relative to the rapid earnings growth analysts expect the company to deliver this year. OTC : BYDD.F BYD Market Cap $123B Today's Change angle-down ( -0.30 %) $ 0.04 Current Price $ 13.45 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Warren Buffett owes a lot to the late Charlie Munger , his longtime friend and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman. He called Munger \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway,\" crediting him with introducing him to the idea that he should focus on buying wonderful businesses at fair prices instead of seeking to buy fair businesses at wonderful prices. The results speak for themselves. Since Buffett received that advice in 1965, he has provided investors with a 20% compound annualized return. Munger was by his side for most of those 60 years, and he found quite a few wonderful businesses to invest in himself. One that Munger convinced Buffett to invest in back in 2008 was a company with leading technology and manufacturing capabilities in the emerging industry of electric vehicles . It was an incredible investment, which has returned over 2,000% on Buffett's original investment to date. And it's not too late for small investors to get in on it. Image source: The Motley Fool. The global EV leader 15 years in the making When Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) released its groundbreaking Roadster in 2008, it demonstrated the potential of electric vehicles. However, that stylish high-end sports car stood in stark contrast to what another EV pioneer was doing across the ocean. That year, Chinese company BYD ( BYDDY 0.59% ) (OTC: BYDD.F) was finalizing designs for the e6, an economical five-door compact car. Guess which one Munger told Buffett to buy. Buffett put $230 million of Berkshire Hathaway's cash to work, buying roughly 10% of BYD. He has since sold off portions of that initial investment, but still holds approximately 4.4% of the company, and that stake is worth about $2.4 billion as of this writing. Expand OTC : BYDD.F BYD Today's Change ( -0.30 %) $ -0.04 Current Price $ 13.45 Key Data Points Market Cap $123B Day's Range $ 12.50 - $ 14.15 52wk Range $ 10.37 - $ 20.50 Volume 172K Avg Vol 368K Gross Margin 17.17 % Dividend Yield 0.04 % BYD didn't even start as an automaker. It started as a battery maker . It focused on reducing its unit costs through vertical integration efforts such as producing key machinery in-house. Keeping its costs low helped it to win big customers, which allowed it to invest in new technology and processes to make its batteries better, which led to further customer wins. The combination of a vertical integration model and a workforce loaded with engineering talent gave BYD some significant advantages. It launched its auto business in 2003, integrating its batteries and other electrical components into the vehicles of a small auto manufacturer it acquired. Within that paradigm, BYD has been able to build cars at impressively low costs. That's what enabled it to launch its first fully electric vehicle -- the e6 -- at the lower end of the market in contrast to Tesla's higher-end models. But BYD was mostly treading water after the launch of the e6. Sales of its electric vehicles cannibalized the sales of its traditional car models. In the late 2010s, it nearly went bankrupt. But its consistent efforts to advance its technology and cut its manufacturing costs started to pay off in 2020, and sales have soared substantially over the last five years. That's thanks to its blade battery, introduced in 2020, which offers advantages in safety, range, longevity, and power. Meanwhile, its two most popular models are priced around $20,000 and $12,000, respectively. Those are hard prices to compete with. Analysts expect BYD's global annual sales of fully electric vehicles to surpass Tesla's for the first time this year. Counterpoint Research sees the EV maker accounting for 15.7% of total EV unit sales compared to Tesla's 15.3%. Here's why it's the electric vehicle company to own BYD's focus on keeping costs low allowed it to survive in the 2010s and now enable it to thrive in 2025. BYD has continued to pursue new ways to vertically integrate, including by buying lithium mining rights in Brazil (which it did in 2023). It also developed its own driver-assist system it dubbed \"God's Eye,\" and is reportedly seeking an SAE Level 4 classification for autonomous driving for its highest-end system. It also includes the system on every model it sells at no additional cost. The combination has enabled BYD to develop low-cost EVs with advanced capabilities. It's no wonder it's selling more units than ever. It reported over 1 million total vehicle sales during the first quarter, 416,000 of which were battery EVs, up 39% year over year. The remainder were mostly hybrids. By comparison, Tesla reported sales of 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter, down 13% year over year. As BYD's sales climb, it's producing significant operating earnings. Its operating margin for 2024 was 7%, right in line with Tesla's, and there's still a lot of leverage in the business. Management projects first-quarter earnings growth between 85% and 118% -- higher than a year ago. By comparison, Tesla's profits are expected to decline by 4% in the first quarter. At its current price, BYD stock trades for about 18 times forward earnings estimates. That's an incredible bargain for a company growing as quickly as the automaker. Despite the strong performance both since the start of the year and since Buffett bought it in 2008, it's still worth adding to your portfolio today.

      "content": "Taking a deeper look at humanoid robots Vahid Karaahmetovic April 13, 2025 3 min read In this article: TSLA Investing.com -- The global race to develop humanoid robots is accelerating, with Macquarie analysts seeing the potential for this sector to reach a total addressable market (TAM) of $1.7 trillion by 2050, on par with today’s global light vehicle market. With software and battery challenges expected to be resolved by the end of this decade, adoption is likely to ramp up sharply in manufacturing and beyond. According to Macquarie, humanoid robots could initially replace 3-4 million final vehicle assembly workers in developed markets, bringing clear cost advantages. Assuming a robot priced at $100,000 with 24/7 operation, the hourly cost is around $5.10—below the U.S. minimum wage and significantly under average labor costs in the auto industry. As production scales, Macquarie expects hardware costs to drop to $20,000, pushing the hourly cost down to just $1.40. “The automotive industry, with labour costs averaging $38.07/ hour in the U.S., more than three times the average $11.23 minimum wage, stands to gain significantly,” Macquarie analysts said in a recent report. Driving this shift is the increasing labor shortage in core manufacturing hubs such as the U.S., China, Japan, and Germany. Retirement of Baby Boomers and a lack of younger replacements have left many jobs unfilled. “Reviving manufacturing industry is a core tenet of ‘Make America Great Again,’” the brokerage notes, pointing to a key political backdrop for automation-driven reshoring. Against this backdrop, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is positioned as a frontrunner. The company has begun testing its Optimus robot and plans to scale production beginning in 2026. Elon Musk envisions a future with “10-30 billion humanoid robots” and expects annual production to hit 1 billion units. Macquarie sees Tesla benefiting from its self-driving technology, mature EV supply chain, and internal demand. But, according to the brokerage, software remains a major hurdle in the humanoid robot industry. Training humanoid robots requires computing power at least 10 times that needed for autonomous driving, according to Tesla. Still, platforms like NVIDIA’s Omniverse and Cosmos are helping standardize development and reduce time to market. “This represents a significant shift towards standardisation in robotics software development and simulation, which in turn should facilitate scalability and broader adoption,” the analysts noted. Furthermore, geopolitical developments may split the market between China and the West. As humanoid robots begin to enter households, privacy and cybersecurity concerns could prompt restrictions on Chinese software and hardware. Story Continues Chinese manufacturers such as Unitree and Agibot are already mass producing on a small scale and could gain early-mover cost advantages. Macquarie believes supply chain firms are among the biggest beneficiaries of humanoid robot market growth. It highlights Zhejiang Sanhua (SZ:002050) and Harmonic (NASDAQ:HLIT) Drive Systems Inc (TYO:6324) as top picks, given their roles in the actuator and speed reducer markets. “Established industry leaders are well positioned to benefit from the early adoption cycle,” the note states. However, the opportunity goes beyond factories. Warehouses, healthcare, and eventually households are seen as future markets. Robots are being tested in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and BMW (ETR:BMWG) facilities, while use cases in elderly care and logistics are expanding.

      "content": "Is Tesla Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire? By Lee Samaha – Apr 13, 2025 at 5:15AM Key Points Tesla is the best-positioned company to deliver on the promise of robotaxis. Despite overpromising and underdelivering on unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service, management says it's on track for a June launch. It has upside potential and significant risk, which likely makes it suitable only for a specific type of investor. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.40 %) $ 15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET Without a doubt, Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) is one of the most intriguing stocks on the market. The polemical views on the company portray it as either a damaged brand with an aging lineup of vehicles on the cusp of being exposed as a hugely overvalued car company -- or a technology company about to explode by unveiling its primary value creator, robotaxis, in due course. Here's the lowdown. Getting to a million dollars First up, some simple math to illustrate how Tesla might make you a millionaire. For the sake of argument, let's assume that Ark Invest's \"expected value\" price target of $2,600 for Tesla stock in 2029 comes true. Then you would have to hold 385 Tesla shares to have $1 million worth of stock. Buying those shares at the time of this writing would cost you just shy of $105,000. Based on just the significant initial outlay required, Tesla stock is unlikely the best candidate for most individual retail investors to become eventual millionaires. Having said that, the stock still has the potential to generate hefty returns. Expand NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Today's Change ( -3.40 %) $ -15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $1442B Day's Range $ 430.17 - $ 451.68 52wk Range $ 214.25 - $ 488.54 Volume 95M Avg Vol 88M Gross Margin 17.01 % Dividend Yield N/A Valuing Tesla I reference Ark's valuation model because it highlights how investors perceive the stock differently. For bulls like Ark, the case for Tesla rests on its robotaxi offerings, which it attributes as being worth 88% of total company value, compared to just 9% for its electric vehicles. That consideration goes a long way toward explaining why Tesla trades at nosebleed valuations compared with the more traditional automakers. Although Tesla is a highly successful EV company, the case for its stock lies in long-term revenue generation from profit sharing on miles driven on robotaxis, and the market knows it. Let's put it this way: Under the Ark model, roughly $2,288 per share comes from robotaxis, and just $234 to Tesla as an EV company. TSLA EV to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts . What you need to believe for the bullish case Consequently, investors need to accept the following: Tesla will release its robotaxi service (possibly featuring its Cybercab) in due course. CEO Elon Musk maintains it will launch \"unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June.\" Tesla's purpose-built robotaxi, Cybercab, will begin volume production soon. Management maintains volume production will start in 2026. Adoption will be rapid, regulatory hurdles will be overcome, and safety concerns will be reassured. Tesla will be able to produce a low-cost Cybercab that can generate significantly lower cost per ride than alternatives like Waymo and traditional cab services. Why Tesla can hit these goals The good news is investors have reason to be positive. First, while relatively high interest rates have negatively impacted automakers' EV plans, Tesla carried on investing and reduced its cost per vehicle to below $35,000 at the end of 2024 from above $38,000 at the start of 2023. That matters because EVs need to be affordable to encourage adoption, the Cybercab needs to be affordable, and management claims it will launch a new \"more affordable\" model in the first half of 2025. Image source: Getty Images. Purely by way of contrast, consider that Ford (a company that told investors in 2016 that it would produce driverless cars by 2021) lost $5.1 billion on its EV segment in 2024. Second, Tesla needs and has leadership in EVs. That's important for robotaxis because it means Tesla has a huge and continuously growing set of data from its Autopilot and Full-Service Driving (FSD) technology on Tesla cars in continuous use. That should enable it to lower the cost per ride and improve its unsupervised FSD solutions. Third, while its declining sales in 2025 have attracted much media attention, the reality is that Tesla had more than 44% market share of EV sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company has the brand recognition and familiarity to succeed with robotaxis. Why Tesla stock is risky Unfortunately, while there are many positives, there are many question marks. Most of the value in the stock is in a technology that's not in service yet. Tesla has a record of overpromising and underdelivering on unsupervised FSD and robotaxis/Cybercab. Will the Austin launch happen? Will the Cybercab be part of it, and will Cybercab be in volume production in 2026? Will the \"more affordable\" model be launched imminently? Will the tariff skirmish with China turn into a war and negatively impact Tesla's cost base, not least because it buys batteries and other components from China? Image source: Getty Images. Is Tesla a millionaire-maker stock? The upside is significant, but so are the risks, making Tesla a stock only for enterprising and speculative investors or those looking to take a relatively small position in a stock with substantive upside potential. It won't suit most investors, and Tesla needs many things to go right before it realizes the potential in Robotaxis/Cybercab. It's not a millionaire maker because few retail investors will be willing to invest the sums necessary to get there, at least on Ark's model. Still, it might suit enterprising investors with a diversified portfolio of stocks who can tolerate risk.

      "content": "Amazon Could Beat Tesla to This Massive Market. Are Investors Missing Something? By Jeremy Bowman – Apr 13, 2025 at 3:25AM Key Points Amazon's Zoox autonomous ride-sharing service is expected to launch this year. Tesla is also planning to begin its robotaxi service in Austin in June. Investors may be underestimating Tesla's competition in the emerging robotaxi market. NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Market Cap $2.4T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET There's been no shortage of woes for Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) this year. The company just reported a 13% decline in first-quarter deliveries. The brand is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis due to CEO Elon Musk's political turn, helming the operation known as the Department of Government Efficiency and weighing in on elections across the U.S. and in Europe. And President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to further weaken the economy, specifically impacting the auto sector. Coming into 2025, Tesla was already struggling as deliveries fell in 2024, marking its first annual decline in unit sales. However, despite those troubles, Tesla stock has been resilient, largely because investors have high hopes for its autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, which Musk said would make Tesla the world's most valuable company. In particular, the Tesla CEO has talked up a robotaxi network from his company, which he believes will be key in achieving that valuation. The company unveiled its Cybercab robotaxi at a launch last October, but the event underwhelmed Wall Street, and it has not yet performed an autonomous vehicle ride. Tesla plans to begin offering autonomous rides in June in Austin, Texas. However, the robotaxi market could get crowded quickly as the company seems to have new competition from Amazon ( AMZN +1.43% ) . Image source: Amazon. Here comes Zoox Amazon is a huge company, best known for its e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses. However, the company also has a self-driving car business after acquiring Zoox for $1.2 billion. Zoox has quietly prepared to launch an autonomous vehicle ride-sharing service in several cities across the country, and it could do so before Tesla. Zoox announced recently that it was launching its sixth testing site in the U.S., this time in Los Angeles. Amazon's ride-sharing service is also aiming to begin serving riders in Las Vegas and San Francisco, though it's unclear when. Zoox is different from most of its autonomous vehicle peers as it has four inward-facing seats, allowing for a more social experience than the typical vehicle and it has double doors that allow for easy entry and exit, making it look more like a shuttle van. The company says it's a robotaxi, not a car. Expand NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Today's Change ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Key Data Points Market Cap $2391B Day's Range $ 221.91 - $ 225.40 52wk Range $ 161.38 - $ 242.52 Volume 1.6M Avg Vol 44M Gross Margin 49.61 % Dividend Yield N/A Can Amazon challenge Tesla in AVs? At this point, it's speculative to assess Zoox's potential in autonomy, but it's clear that the space is becoming more crowded as Alphabet 's Waymo continues to spread to new cities and as other companies work toward autonomous ride-sharing. Tesla is also facing deep-pocketed rivals in Alphabet and Amazon, both of which generate tens of billions of annual free cash flow, some of which they can throw at the autonomous vehicle market. Tesla does have a singular advantage with millions of cars on the road, but its full self-driving technology still requires supervision. Launch of the ride-sharing service is expected to include unsupervised full self-driving, available to Tesla owners. If the technology proves to be capable of navigating the roads safely, it could be the game changer that Musk hopes it will be as the millions of Tesla owners could subscribe to FSD and theoretically lease their own vehicles out for ride-sharing -- provided the software is there to support it. However, the arrival of well-heeled debutantes like Zoox shows that Tesla may not dominate the robotaxi market the way the bulls expect. It's also worth remembering the safety risks in AVs. Other companies' autonomous dreams have gone up in smoke, including Uber Technologies and General Motors , which recently pulled all its Cruise vehicles off the road and ended that program.

Amazon, on the other hand, has a much more diversified revenue base, a cheaper valuation, and better growth prospects, considering the problems with Tesla's EV business. Zoox's ramp-up toward a mainstream AV company is likely to be significantly slower than Tesla's, but safety is the biggest hurdle in the industry, not speed. Overall, Amazon looks like the better buy here. While Zoox might not be a major factor in its business right now, it could be down the road, and it gives investors potential exposure to the robotaxi market. Keep an eye on Zoox over the coming months as 2025 looks set to be a big year for robotaxis.

      "content": "A Tesla Model S Plaid is displayed at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, China, on November 6, 2022. Tang Ke/Feature China/Future Publishing/Getty Images CNN — Tesla has suspended taking new orders for Model S and Model X vehicles on its Chinese website, Reuters checks showed on Friday, as the world’s two largest economies exchange blows in a trade war. Both models are made in the U.S. and imported to China. New orders for the two models were also no longer available on the automaker’s WeChat mini program account in China. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the company did not give a reason for the move, it comes as China and U.S. have been locked in an escalating trade war. China on Friday raised its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% on Friday after President Donald Trump’s decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145%. Higher U.S. tariffs significantly increases the retail cost for Chinese consumers, making these cars more expensive than locally produced EVs. The Austin, Texas-based company is least affected by Trump’s tariffs among automakers due to its largely domestic manufacturing for sales in the U.S. The U.S. automaker makes Model 3 and Model Y cars at its plant in Shanghai for sale in the country and export to markets such as Europe, making up the vast majority of its sales. China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024, said Li Yanwei, an analyst with the China Auto Dealers Association. The two models accounted for less 0.5% of Tesla’s deliveries of more than 657,000 vehicles last year. Increasing competition from BYD 002594.SZ and other local manufacturers has also hit sales of Tesla’s vehicles in China. Deliveries of the category that includes Tesla’s premium sedan and SUV models and the Cybertruck were down 25% in the first quarter globally, largely due to the lack of upgrades to the vehicles and backlash against CEO Elon Musk’s politics."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention. In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution. OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology. Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity. OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now and 9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today “Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,” In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI. “Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

      "content": "Is Tesla Stock a Buy Now? By Johnny Rice – Apr 12, 2025 at 10:15AM Key Points Tesla's sales have hit a major rough patch as the company struggles domestically and abroad. Tesla's future of robotaxis and personal robots is still many years from being commercially viable. It is still a car company first and foremost. NASDAQ : TSLA Tesla Market Cap $1.4T Today's Change angle-down ( -3.40 %) $ 15.26 Current Price $ 433.72 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET It's been a chaotic week for investors. The Dow Jones , the S&P 500 , and the Nasdaq Composite all saw one of the worst multi-day stretches in years. This comes as a trade war escalated between the U.S. and its major trade partners, with China and the E.U. responding in kind to President Donald Trump's steep, sweeping new levies on goods from nearly every country in the world. To say markets were nervous is an understatement. That's now given way to optimism after Trump lowered tariffs on all partners save for China. Amid the tumult, some investors are looking to buy stocks at what could be a discount. Could Tesla ( TSLA 3.40% ) be the right pick? The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer's stock has slid more than 6% since last Wednesday, when the tariffs were announced, before rebounding significantly. Still, Tesla stock is down nearly 45% from its high in January. That's despite Tesla actually being profitable -- not something many of its EV competitors can say -- an innovator in autonomous driving and robotics , and its energy storage business growing rapidly. So, is Tesla the right opportunity right now? Tesla is many things, but first and foremost, it's a carmaker While the company is working on several innovative technologies that could prove transformative, the fact is, at present, it is primarily a car manufacturer. Of the $97.7 billion in total sales it reported last year, more than $77.1 billion came from sales of its lineup of cars. While EV rivals Rivian and Lucid Group both struggle to turn a profit, Tesla ranks as one of the world's top 10 most profitable automotive companies. It's a far cry from the hugely profitable Toyota , but Tesla's bottom line beats out American producers GM and Ford , among others. This is despite lower sales. Tesla's margins are higher than its domestic competition, allowing the company to deliver top-tier earnings despite total sales of roughly half that of GM and Ford. That means Tesla has significant headroom to grow sales -- good news for investors. Sales are slipping Here's the thing: Tesla isn't growing sales. In fact, its vehicle sales are shrinking. The company's latest delivery report showed it had delivered just 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter, making it the worst quarter for deliveries since 2022. We are still several weeks out from Tesla's earnings call , in which more details will come to light, but as of Tesla's 2024 report, the once double-digit year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth the company enjoyed is gone. Its sales grew by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024. This trend may be accelerating. Targeted reports from individual markets around the globe show Tesla's car sales tanking while overall EV sales soar. Tesla's E.U. sales dropped 45% in January, while the EV market rose 37% YOY. The company's sales in China dropped 11.5% YOY in March, while sales in France hit their lowest level since 2021. Why? While these kinds of trends are always multivariate, it's impossible to ignore CEO Elon Musk's foray into politics at home and abroad. Over the last year, the Tesla chief has become an increasingly polarizing figure. As the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has overseen a campaign of controversial cost-cutting at home while inserting himself in the local politics of countries from Germany to the U.K. His actions have caused, as JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman puts it, \"unprecedented brand damage\" that could be the major driver in Tesla's sliding sales. At the same time, Tesla is facing stronger competition from legacy manufacturers and the Chinese EV maker BYD . The lead it once enjoyed in the eyes of consumers as the pioneer of the EV industry has largely evaporated. Tesla has a valuation issue Even if sales weren't struggling to the degree they are, there is a major issue with the stock's valuation . The company's stock trades at more than 130 times earnings. That is extremely high for any kind of company -- tech included -- let alone a car manufacturer. Look at how much higher Tesla's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is than its competition's. Now, I freely admit that there is more to Tesla than simply making cars -- its energy storage business is growing at a healthy clip at the moment. The company is working to deliver self-driving functionality to its customers. Musk touts a future filled with his company's robotaxis and personal robots. The company has its hand in many pies that, one day, could be very lucrative. This doesn't change that, at the moment and for the foreseeable future, Tesla is a car company. The vast majority of its revenue comes from selling the cars it produces. The promise of future transformative technologies can distract from this simple fact. So, if you choose to invest in Tesla, know that you are buying a future that is far from guaranteed. The stock price is far too high for what is primarily a car company, especially one seeing its sales growth stagnate. I have serious doubts that Tesla will deliver on Musk's promises in any kind of meaningful time frame or, for that matter, at all. Tesla stock is not a buy now .
