##  How It Works

1. **Data Retrieval**  
   The user inputs a stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL`). The frontend sends this query to the backend API.

2. **AI Analysis**  
   The **FastAPI** backend (in `main.py` and `analyzer.py`) processes data and executes AI models to generate predictions and summaries.

3. **Data Storage**  
   **MongoDB** stores user analyses, summaries, and insights for future visualization.

4. **Display**  
   The **Next.js** frontend (in `src/app/analysis/page.tsx`) retrieves and renders AI-generated insights, charts, sentiment data, and summaries.

##  Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

###  Synchronizing Backend and Frontend Data
### üîó Synchronizing Backend and Frontend Data
**Challenge:**  
Ensuring smooth communication between the FastAPI backend and the Next.js frontend without latency or data mismatches.  

**Solution:**  
Used **Supabase** for real-time user authentication and session management, and **MongoDB** for persistent data storage and synchronization across user sessions.  
This combination allowed reliable communication between the backend API and the frontend, ensuring that data, analytics results, and user history remained consistent and up-to-date.

###  Managing Authentication
**Challenge:**  
Integrating Supabase-based authentication while maintaining persistent user sessions.  
**Solution:**  
Developed a modular `useAuth.ts` hook to handle login, registration, and session validation efficiently.

---

### ‚ö° Handling Real-Time Updates
**Challenge:**  
Ensuring analysis results stay current with new market data.  
**Solution:**  
Implemented **client-side polling** and **React state updates**, allowing data to refresh seamlessly without reloading the page.

---

###  Frontend Consistency
**Challenge:**  
Designing a visually cohesive interface across multiple modules (stocks, news, insights).  
**Solution:**  
Used **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** to maintain a clean, consistent, and responsive UI with minimal custom CSS.
