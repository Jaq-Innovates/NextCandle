    "explanation": "Procter & Gamble's stock has recently seen some dips and underperformed compared to the wider market, causing some concern among investors. However, there's a strong belief that the company is on the brink of significant changes, as it's reportedly cutting operations in some areas and restructuring its brands to become more efficient and improve its profits (the money it makes after paying for costs). PG is also actively promoting its products with new campaigns, such as a major collaboration for its Gain and Dawn brands with the upcoming 'Wicked' movie. All eyes are now on the company's financial results, due out later this month, to see how these strategic moves are impacting its performance as a reliable company known for consistently sharing a portion of its earnings with shareholders.",

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.37%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.14%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.71%. Coming into today, shares of the world's largest consumer products maker had lost 4.84% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 3.28%, while the S&P 500 gained 4.26%. Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Procter & Gamble in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on October 24, 2025. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.9, down 1.55% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $22.21 billion, indicating a 2.18% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year. For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.99 per share and a revenue of $86.94 billion, representing changes of +2.34% and +3.16%, respectively, from the prior year. Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Procter & Gamble. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability. Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system. The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.01% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Procter & Gamble is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Procter & Gamble has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.79 right now. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 21.47. We can additionally observe that PG currently boasts a PEG ratio of 4.02. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Consumer Products - Staples industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.81. Story Continues The Consumer Products - Staples industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 174, finds itself in the bottom 30% echelons of all 250+ industries. The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

      "text": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About P&G (PG): Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research October 6, 2025 4 min read In this article: PG Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.94, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.94 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 46.2% and 11.5% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PG Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PG Check price target & stock forecast for P&G here>>> While the ABR calls for buying P&G, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. Story Continues It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. Is PG a Good Investment? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for P&G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0% over the past month to $6.99. Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for P&G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&G with a grain of salt.

      "text": "'We threw phone cases from a 250-metre-high dam to show that our products work' Rod Gilmour · Feature writer 4 October 2025 7 min read In this article: ^FTSE +0.70% AAPL +1.25% PG +0.88% James Griffith has experienced plenty of hurdles in his role as co-founder and CEO of Mous. A buoyant James Griffith has just returned from an annual marketing stunt where the Mous co-founder and CEO — or, on this occasion, a base jumper on top of a 250-metre high dam in Switzerland — throws one of the company’s high-performance accessory products to test durability at 100mph speeds. The British entrepreneur has been toughening up protective phone cases, and now its soon-to-launch hardshell luggage, every year since co-founding Mous in 2014, when he had to come up with novel ways to get his startup noticed. “When we first launched, it was a complete disaster because no one was buying them as people didn't know about them,” admits Griffith. Read More: Meet the British billionaire who still works harder than anyone he knows The designer, who was working at Procter & Gamble ( PG ), teamed up with university friend Josh Shires, who was experimenting with a 3D printer in his room and trying to make tech accessories. In a flooded market, the duo knew they had to create a unique product to stand out in the phone category. Their first design was a phone case that wound in headphones — “a terrible product and badly designed,” says Griffith — as they put their life savings of around £40,000, including a £7,000 loan from Virgin StartUp, into their concepts and learned how to develop products. With a few months left of their dwindling funds, they decided to move to China, prolonging cash flow by a year and eliminating the need for constant video calls to Asia. They subsequently spent over two years working on product development for western companies and factories before mulling how to reposition Mous. “Just out of fear of failure we thought to do everything to our best ability,” recalls Griffith. However, a crowdfunding campaign stalled and bankruptcy loomed, largely after being told not to use magnetic phone cases, before Griffith approached brand expert and fellow co-founder Lucy Hutchinson. She became “hooked” by the prospect of consumers being excited by a phone case. James Griffith has played a role in plenty of marketing stunts to test Mous' protective phone cases. Griffith’s first stunt was to stand outside an Apple ( AAPL ) Store in London, throwing his phone to the floor. Security, he says, weren’t too keen and after moving outside Griffith saw the general public recording his demonstrations. The crowdfunding gathered momentum, and he soon had 50,000 backers and 2.5 million preorders. Getting noticed has clearly worked, too. The firm's recent stunt from the Swiss dam , in which an iPhone 17 in a protective Mous case survived the drop, has already garnered 30 million organic views across social media. Story Continues “We're trying to build a household brand and to do that you need to make yourselves famous, so we'll keep doing that until we're a proper brand,” says Griffith, who started his first business as a 15-year-old selling products on eBay ( EBAY ), having also struggled with dyslexia at school. Read More: 'We were told being bald is bad — but our skincare gel hit 8,000 orders in one month' Mous’ rise has also been a rollercoaster journey. Take the iPhone 10 launch when Griffith had borrowed a guaranteed £2.5m in debt from HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and realised that Apple had moved the compass in its phone, leading to the magnets used in Mous cases being positioned directly underneath. Griffith realised the problem firsthand when he went out on a date on Apple’s launch day and found himself getting lost while using his phone's maps. “It dawned on us that all of our stock was completely useless,” he says. Hours of brainstorming to find ways to demagnetise and revive one case saved their stock — and the company. Meanwhile, a second potential financial crisis was averted when Apple launched MagSafe, which became incompatible with Mous’ own pioneering magnetic ecosystem of wallets and phone cases. Today, the London startup’s product team of around 35 engineers is pushing the engineering boundaries to foresee future problems. “Internally, we call it ‘Mous mix’, where we're mixing our product development with other content,” says Griffith. “We've got some world-class engineers in the business, and we're really innovating in areas where we can make market-leading products. “One of our capabilities is that we've been all around energy control. We're on to our seventh-generation case, and protecting larger devices is actually a lot more difficult because there's more mass and force.” In 2018, Griffith had first tried to pitch private equity on the technology going into Mous’ luggage and backpack products, but couldn’t yield any funding. “The feedback often seemed like ‘bit of a weird guy, I think he's obsessed with throwing things off buildings, so just stick to phone cases’.\" Mous has launched its luggage products. Its backpack range is now Mous’ fastest-growing category, and Griffith believes that its luggage line will soon rival it. Griffith’s business vision has run alongside dealing with dyslexia as a \"neurodivergent entrepreneur\". He has overcome adversity since needing help reading as a 17-year-old at school. Last month, Virgin StartUp and the charity Made By Dyslexia released an analysis suggesting that around one in three entrepreneurs in the UK is dyslexic. The data showed that these founders generate over £4.6bn a year for the economy and secure over 60,000 jobs. “If you've got encouraging parents and good teachers, then you can get through it,” says Griffith. “It results in you becoming quite relentless because you've managed to constantly learn how to deal with that struggle and end up with more coping mechanisms. “In the business world, you can't do much on your own, and you have to get quite good at building a fantastic team. “There's someone in the business who's better than me at everything. I think of it like the game Top Trumps. You don't want to focus on having a card which has got three stars for everything. You just need to find a card that's got five stars, and it doesn't matter if there is a one star.” Read More: 'I pitched my car finance idea to my mother-in-law and she got it straight away' Griffith says this plays into being able to delegate. For example, as CEO, he admits to only sending an average of three emails per week. “You know you need to build this fantastic team around you and trust other people to build something special,” he adds. It leaves Griffith more time to devise more diverse guerilla marketing tactics to stand out and grow globally. Ironically, this summer, Griffith travelled to Necker Island to meet Virgin founder Richard Branson. Branson quit school at the age of 15 due to dyslexia and has attracted global headlines for his business stunts over the decades. “The funny thing is, with some of these stunts you need to have a low ego because you need to be OK with looking a bit of an idiot,\" smiles Griffith, \"but at the same time, have this relentless drive to try and get something to work.” He adds that it also demonstrates that the products actually work. This has helped Mous and its four co-founders earn £32m in company revenue last year and grow to a growing army of 1 million customers worldwide. CEO Says: James Griffith on… Dyslexic thinking \"I realised early on that the whole class would try and solve a maths problem one way, but I would do it in a different way, and still get to the same answer. That thinking can be really useful if you pair it with a great team. It allows you to find opportunities or an approach that is different to the market and that can be really quite powerful.\" Collaborations \"We've been working on some pretty awesome luggage with the Mercedes-AMG F1 team. They chose to partner with us because, as engineers"

Europe Household Care Market Outlook and Growth Analysis Report 2025-2034 Featuring Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Henkel, Clorox, SC Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser, Church & Dwight, Colgate-Palmolive Research and Markets October 2, 2025 5 min read In this article: ULVR.L PG HEN3.DE CLX RKT.L Company Logo Opportunities in the Europe household care market include growing demand due to rising hygiene consciousness, especially in premium segments. Germany leads market growth, supported by robust economies and urbanization. Online product availability and eco-friendly innovations further drive expansion. Dublin, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Europe Household Care Market Size and Share Outlook - Forecast Trends and Growth Analysis Report (2025-2034)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Europe household care market, along with its professional cleaning and hygiene product industry, reached a total production value of approximately USD 31.90 Billion in 2024. Germany is the major consumer market of household care products in Europe. In 2020, the Germany household care industry attained a value of nearly USD 6.4 billion. The household care industry in Germany is anticipated to expect a further growth in demand, thus, aiding the growth of the Europe household care market in the forecast period of 2025-2034. Europe is one of the world's major consumers of household care products. While the Europe household care market has risen by 1.2% in 2017 since 2016, the washing and hygiene industry has grown by 1.7% in 2017 relative to 2016. In 2017, the household care segment in the EU witnessed an annual turnover of nearly EUR 28.6 billion, hence, giving the household care industry further momentum for its growth in the region. Home care products such as laundry care, surface care, dishwashing products dominate the industry in Europe. Laundry care, especially, is the leading segment in the Europe household care industry. The region is the second largest market for laundry detergents after the Asia-Pacific region. North America and the Asia-Pacific are the other major consumers of household care products. The household care markets in the two regions are being driven by the growing population and rising disposable incomes of the consumers. Some of the leading markets in the Asia-Pacific region are China and India, while the US is a leading market in North America. The younger population in the Asia-Pacific and North America regions are becoming more aware about health and hygiene issues and are, thus, further aiding the demand growth for household care products in this region. Market Analysis The European region has some of the world's largest economies of the world like Germany, UK, France, and Italy. The region's robust economy is aiding the growth of the Europe household care market. With the growing middle-class population and rapid urbanisation in Europe, the demand for household care products has increased. The middle and high-income classes in the region are especially driving the growth of the premium segment of the household care industry. The rising hygiene consciousness and a growing adoption of a healthier lifestyle are major driving factors for the household care industry in Europe. With the European population becoming more health and hygiene conscious, they are increasingly seeking out products that are organic and free from harmful chemicals. The rise in innovation and product diversification will further aid the industry growth in the region. The easy availability of household care products online is further pushing the industry forward with major players leveraging the distribution channel by streamlining their packaging for e-retail purposes.

This initiative aims to boost productivity, reallocate resources toward innovation, and enable a sharper focus on the company’s core, more profitable segments amid economic pressures and calls from activist investors for improved cost efficiency. We'll examine how the company's workforce reduction and portfolio streamlining could influence Procter & Gamble's longer-term growth outlook. Uncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward .

The recent restructuring plan, which includes 7,000 job cuts and product line simplification, aims to enhance productivity and focus, yet is unlikely to materially change near-term catalysts like market share gains or immediate risks such as consumer spending volatility and input costs.

The company will instead use third-party distributors to sell its products in the country. This decision follows similar withdrawals from Bangladesh, Argentina, and Nigeria. Procter & Gamble will halt business operations in Pakistan as part of its two-year restructuring plan , according to a news report . The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant has disclosed it plans to wind down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan and rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers in the country, according to Reuters . P&G exit part of restructuring The move comes after P&G said it would pull out of Bangladesh as part of its plans to cut 7,000 nonmanufacturing jobs, announced in summer.  By mid-2027, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors said it would cut 6.4% of its 109,000 employees worldwide to free up money to reinvest into its business. P&G’s plans to slim down weigh heavily on its hometown where the company employs around 10,000 mostly office workers. USA TODAY Shopping: Shop sales in tech, home, fashion, beauty & more curated by our editors. International sales part of sluggish performance P&G’s cuts come after its 2024 organic sales growth (which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures) slowed to a seven-year low. The company vowed to review its operations, including sluggish international markets. In July, P&G revealed its core markets of the U.S., China, Japan, Canada and Western Europe saw organic sales growth of 2% last year versus “enterprise markets” lagged growing just 1%. P&G has exited whole countries before: last year it shut down operations in Argentina and Nigeria in 2023."
