  "summary": "Meta is significantly boosting its commitment to artificial intelligence, investing tens of billions of dollars to construct massive data centers that will power its advanced AI tools. While making these huge infrastructure bets, the company is also reorganizing its AI division by letting go of around 600 employees, likely to streamline its development efforts. Financial experts are generally optimistic, expecting Meta to announce that it earned more money (meaning its profits grew) when it reports its latest quarterly results, driven by strong advertising performance and initial benefits from its AI initiatives, which usually makes people more interested in buying its stock. However, a broader concern exists in the market that the rapid rise of AI companies, including Meta, might be creating an \"AI bubble\" where stock prices are growing too fast and could potentially face a downturn.",

(META) Stock META Cedric Pfort 143 Follower s Follow 5 Share Save Play ( 17min ) Comments (7) Summary Meta Platforms is transforming into a vertically integrated AI infrastructure leader, controlling every layer from data centers to proprietary AI models. Metaâs massive CAPEX in AI infrastructure is building long-term assets, driving future operating leverage, margin expansion, and new profitable revenue streams. Despite industry-leading margins and its strategic positioning, Meta trades at a discount to tech peers, making the current price an appealing buying opportunity. I initiate coverage on the stock with a Strong Buy rating, citing its unique AI value chain integration and attractive valuation amid the ongoing AI super cycle.

      "text": "1 Unstoppable Trillion-Dollar Stock to Buy and Hold Forever By Prosper Junior Bakiny – Oct 23, 2025 at 10:15AM Key Points Meta Platforms has a strong competitive moat from at least two sources. Its financial results are excellent, and it boasts significant growth opportunities. Despite some potential obstacles, the tech leader looks like a great buy-and-hold option. NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Market Cap $1.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 0.59 %) $ 4.36 Current Price $ 738.36 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET It's not too late to get in on this longtime market-beater -- far from it. Some investors might be tempted to avoid the largest stocks on the market -- those worth more than $1 trillion, for instance -- due to their sheer size. Smaller companies surely have much more room to grow and can provide stronger returns over the long run, or can they? In my view, most trillion-dollar companies remain among the most attractive long-term investments on the market. Take Meta Platforms ( META +0.59% ) , the leader in the social media industry. The tech giant boasts prospects that would make most significantly smaller companies envious. And even after providing life-changing returns, it has plenty more in the tank for investors who stay the course. Image source: Getty Images. Powered by an impenetrable moat There are about 8.1 billion people in the world. Almost half of them, 3.5 billion to be exact, visit at least one of Meta Platforms' famous websites or apps daily. Few corporations have an ecosystem of users that even approaches this number. And it's not just sheer size. Meta Platforms benefits from a strong economic moat that allows it to grow its user base continuously. Meta's apps display powerful network effects . Take Instagram, a platform people use to keep up with friends and family members, influencers use to build an audience, and businesses utilize to market products. The more people are on Instagram, the more attractive it is for all those purposes. The same can be said about Facebook. And once people (or businesses or influencers) have built a significant presence on these apps, leaving makes little sense, as it would often force them to start from scratch. In other words, Meta Platforms also benefits from high switching costs . The tech leader's deep ecosystem grants it significant monetization opportunities. It continues to make most of its sales from advertising. And despite some obstacles, such as a slowdown in ad demand a few years ago, Meta Platforms' revenue and earnings growth have been strong. Further, Meta Platforms has terrific growth opportunities. The company has significantly improved its advertising business thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered algorithms are helping boost engagement on its apps by recommending the kind of content that keeps viewers glued to their screens. That automatically makes the company's platforms even more attractive to advertisers. On the other side of the equation, it has used AI to improve the ad launch process, leading to higher return on ad spend for companies. Meta Platforms is planning to automate the advertising process entirely by the end of next year, thanks to AI, which could provide yet another boost to its business. Meanwhile, by allowing people to use its large language model , Llama, which powers much of its internal AI initiatives free of charge, Meta Platforms thinks it will attract talented developers who will make Llama the market leader, leading to significantly positive spillover effects throughout its entire business. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.59 %) $ 4.36 Current Price $ 738.36 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.15 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 9.2M Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % There are also other potential opportunities for the company. Meta Platforms is a leader in AI glasses , a business that could eventually have a meaningful impact on its financial results. The company is still working on ways to monetize WhatsApp, which has significantly lagged its other platforms in its contributions to the top line. Businesses can now start channels on the platform and charge subscribers for exclusive premium features (Meta Platforms will take a cut). There are also paid messaging features that allow businesses to communicate directly with customers, while Meta Platforms announced it will start posting ads on the \"Updates\" tab of the app. WhatsApp boasts about 3 billion monthly active users, but we are still arguably in the early innings of Meta's efforts to monetize the platform. That's a great sign for the future. Buy and forget Meta Platforms will encounter headwinds. President Trump's tariff policies could affect ad demand in Asia. In fact, it already has. Meta Platforms could also continue to face intense scrutiny from regulators like it has in recent years. None of these potential obstacles should scare off investors, though. Meta Platforms' business and financial results are excellent (and generally improving), its competitive edge is rock solid, and it has demonstrated its ability to overcome challenges before, including economic issues that led to a slowdown in ad demand, as well as damage to its public image. On top of all that, Meta is now a dividend stock, having initiated a payout last year. For all those reasons (and more), Meta Platforms is a fantastic forever pick.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This provider of digital banking services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +66.7%. Revenues are expected to be $113.95 million, up 32.6% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.29% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for ALKT Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. Story Continues A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alkami? For Alkami, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.45%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alkami will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alkami would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of +44.44%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Alkami doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Another stock from the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Meta Platforms (META), is soon expected to post earnings of $6.6 per share for the quarter ended September 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +9.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $49.43 billion, up 21.8% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Meta Platforms has been revised 0.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of +3.37%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that Meta Platforms will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

META FUNDS WATER REPLENISHMENT INITIATIVE IN WYOMING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL TECH COMPANY FROG CREEK PARTNERS Innosphere Thu, October 23, 2025 at 10:00 AM EDT 3 min read In this article: META Diagram of Gutter Bin Drop Inlet Filter Diagram of Gutter Bin Drop Inlet Filter Casper, WYO., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meta is funding the installation of 180 Gutter Bin® stormwater filtration devices near its Cheyenne, Wyoming data center, collaborating with the City of Cheyenne and Casper-based company Frog Creek Partners, an NSF ASCEND Engine -funded company powered by Innosphere , to revive Cheyenne’s Crow Creek. This partnership is part of Meta’s broader commitment to become water positive in 2030—restoring more water than is consumed by their operations to the watersheds where they operate, including restoring 100 percent of the water used in medium water-stress areas and 200 percent of the water used in high water-stress areas. Frog Creek’s patent-pending Gutter Bins trap debris, sediment, heavy metals, and tire treads allowing the filtered water to continue to the creek. Because the device captures pollutants before the water reaches vital ecosystems, it’s a powerful tool for keeping flora and fauna safe from the toxic chemicals and other contaminants commonly found on city streets. This is Frog Creek Partners’ third collaborative project with tech companies in Cheyenne. The first two, a 2021 installation of 67 Gutter Bins and a 2025 installation of 127 Gutter Bins, were both sponsored by Microsoft. The existing Gutter Bins already in the city have captured tens of thousands of pounds of pollution, bolstering the city’s efforts to reduce their pollution footprint. “Meta is proud to invest in projects that restore and protect local water resources. We believe that restoring water to local communities reflects our commitment to responsible innovation and caring for the places where we live and work,” said Stefanie Woodward, Head of Water Restoration at Meta. Meta has funded over 40 water restoration projects since 2017. In 2024 alone, these operational restoration projects returned over 1.6 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions. The company’s water stewardship program is designed to address shared water challenges in the watersheds where Meta operates, collaborating with local organizations and utilities to invest in solutions that benefit both communities and ecosystems. Each project is selected aiming to ensure a lasting positive impact, and progress is measured using rigorous, third-party verified methodologies. A more in-depth look at Meta’s water restoration projects can be found here . “We’re grateful to collaborate with Meta on efforts that directly benefit local watersheds and the people who depend on them.” said Brian Deurloo, founder of Frog Creek Partners. “Their proactive approach to environmental stewardship fits perfectly with our mission to restore clean water at the community level.” Story continues Cheyenne’s Crow Creek is on the Environmental Protection Agency’s 303(d) list of impaired waterways for sediment and E. Coli pollution. Due to its status, the creek requires an action plan to reduce daily pollution levels in order to comply with a total maximum daily load (TMDL) limit imposed by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. Meta’s Cheyenne stormwater filtration project is expected to restore 10.9 million gallons of water annually.

Oct 22 - Meta ( NASDAQ:META ) is about to cut about 600 jobs across its artificial intelligence division as part of efforts to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The layoffs affect teams working in Meta's AI infrastructure, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research, and related product groups. Employees were informed their roles will end Nov. 21, though they remain on paid notice until then. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META. Is META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, who joined in June following Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, said the restructuring aims to reduce layers and help teams move faster. Meta will provide at least 16 weeks of severance pay, plus two additional weeks for each year of service. The move comes as Meta invests heavily to compete with artificial intelligence leaders like OpenAI and Google (GOOGL). CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been dissatisfied with the pace of progress after the release of the company's Llama 4 models earlier this year. Following its investment in Scale AI, Meta formed the Superintelligence Labs unit, co-led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, to accelerate large-scale AI development. Meta shares slipped about 1% in afternoon trading. The company will report third-quarter earnings next week. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Tesla Opens Mag 7 Earnings Season to Mixed Reviews The all-powerful cohort continues to define the broader market, which has officially been placed on the “bubble watchlist.” Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Mail Link October 23, 2025 Photo by Bram van Oost via Unsplash Sign up for smart news, insights, and analysis on the biggest financial stories of the day. Subscribe Brian Boyle brian@thedailyupside.com October 23, 2025 We love all of our earnings seasons, but this one has been special. Now, the quarterly reporting calendar has advanced to the slots reserved for the Magnificent Seven, with Tesla sharing its performance on Wednesday, while its six peers are scheduled to follow next week. The powerful cohort continues to define the broader market, which has officially been placed on the “bubble watchlist” as the current bull run gallops into its fourth year. Will it continue to go wherever the Mag 7 leads it? Touching the Sun The companies in the elite group — Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Nvidia — account for just over one-third of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF that tracks them, meanwhile, has risen roughly 35% in the past year, while the broader S&P 500 has increased by about 15%. The group is expected to continue to trounce its broader market peers in this quarter’s earnings season. According to analysts surveyed by FactSet , the Mag 7 is likely to post collective earnings growth of 15% in the third quarter, more than double the 6.7% growth of “The Other 493.” Still, the chasm is narrower than in recent quarters, and analysts suspect that by this time next year, the bottom 493 companies will be largely driving market gains. After all, how much bigger can a $4 trillion company get? Already, some big bellwether names within the lowly “Other 493” are reporting tailwinds: On the consumer side, Coca-Cola beat Wall Street’s expectations earlier this week, while General Motors raised its operating forecast for the rest of the year on Tuesday, citing robust demand. That comes after major banks reported bumper profits last week, and as major industrial firms like 3M and GE Aerospace post strong earnings as well. So far, 76% of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings-per-share projections, BofA Global Research analysts told MarketWatch on Tuesday, besting a 68% historical average. The strong performances may continue through next year: FactSet data projects that the Bottom 493 will reach similar earnings growth by the third quarter of 2026, while the Mag 7 remains level. Open Road: Tesla revved its engine after the bell on Wednesday with an unsurprising revenue beat, as US consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles before the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal government EV tax credit. However, the company’s profit per share of just 50 cents fell below consensus expectations of 55 cents, dragging Tesla shares down 2% in after-hours trading. Of the Mag 7, only Nvidia, the largest company in the world and the No. 1 beneficiary of Big Tech’s historic AI spending, is expected to be a top five contributor to S&P 500 earnings growth in the third quarter, according to FactSet research.

The reason why? Artificial intelligence . BNP Paribas chief US economist James Egelhof put it bluntly in a roundtable with reporters this week: “AI has kept the economy out of a recession.” AI-driven investment has offset the drag from higher rates, fueling a surge in data center and chip spending that’s kept growth humming. Bank of America Research estimates AI-related capex added 1.3 percentage points to second quarter GDP growth, while small business payments to tech services jumped nearly 7% year over year in September as adoption spreads beyond Big Tech. Even outside the AI buildout, the ripple effects are clear: Soaring stock prices have fueled high-end spending , and a surge in business confidence has kept companies hiring and investing, rather than hitting the brakes. “The AI boom has convinced the broader business community that a robust expansion and productivity surge lies just over the horizon,” Egelhof said. That strength has given the Fed cover to start easing even with inflation above target — which Egelhof called “buying insurance for the labor market” at the cost of “somewhat suboptimal, inflationary outcomes.” For now, AI’s productivity gains have made that trade-off easier to stomach. But they’ve also reshaped aspects of the current financial system — temporarily, at least. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk said the AI boom has \"broken\" the transmission mechanism for monetary policy. ( Disclosure: Apollo is Yahoo's parent company. ) Normally, higher rates choke off corporate spending, but AI infrastructure is being financed by soaring equity valuations , not debt. That means tighter policy hasn’t slowed investment, or cooled the economy, the way it normally would. El presidente de la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos, Jerome Powell, habla en una conferencia de prensa tras la reunión del Comité Federal de Mercado Abierto, el miércoles 17 de septiembre de 2025, en el edificio del Consejo de la Reserva Federal, en Washington. (AP Foto/Jacquelyn Martin) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Meta ( META ), Alphabet ( GOOG ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) now account for more than a quarter of all S&P 500 capex, growing at a 75% annual clip. And it will surprise no one that office construction has plunged since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, but data center projects have exploded, powered by equity gains in the “Magnificent Seven.” Another case of the K-shaped economy As Sløk put it, “What matters for capex decisions are broader financial conditions and not just the fed funds rate.\" Story Continues He added, \"There is basically no growth in corporate capex outside of AI.” BNP group chief economist Isabelle Mateos y Lago captured the mood at the IMF meetings earlier this month: “There was a palpable sense of AI optimism,” she said. “AI is saving the day.” It’s also rewriting the rules.

      "text": "CoreWeave's Next Act: Where the Growth Will Come From By Lawrence Nga – Oct 23, 2025 at 6:00AM Key Points Existing customers remain CoreWeave’s strongest growth engine. The company is moving beyond artificial intelligence labs into other industries. Vertical integration strengthens CoreWeave’s control and long-term margins. NASDAQ : CRWV CoreWeave Market Cap $66B Today's Change angle-down ( 7.47 %) $ 9.21 Current Price $ 132.55 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET CoreWeave is evolving into a full-stack artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure company, and it's not stopping anytime soon. CoreWeave ( CRWV +7.47% ) has become one of the fastest-growing companies in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure race. In just a few years, it has gone from a niche GPU cloud provider to a critical player powering the compute backbone for companies like OpenAI, Microsoft , and Meta Platforms . But as the AI boom enters its next phase, investors are asking: Where will CoreWeave's growth come from next? Here are three essential levers that the company can pull to keep growth coming and help it evolve from a GPU supplier into a long-term AI infrastructure platform. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Capturing more workloads from existing customers CoreWeave's most immediate growth opportunity lies in expanding workloads from the customers it already serves. Many of its largest clients -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta -- are scaling AI usage across training and inference at a staggering pace. For CoreWeave, that means the potential to grow \"inside\" these accounts, even without adding new logos. Once the cloud company builds and configures GPU clusters for a client, scaling additional capacity becomes far more efficient. The infrastructure, tooling, and service integrations are already in place -- turning each existing customer into a multiyear growth engine. This dynamic is evident in the company's revenue backlog , which hit $30.1 billion as of June 30, reflecting contracted compute commitments and multiyear take-or-pay agreements. Comparatively, revenue in that quarter was $1.2 billion, suggesting revenue will scale even faster in the future. In fact, the cloud company signed another agreement with OpenAI on Sept. 25, bringing the total contract value with the latter to $22.4 billion. As AI workloads become larger and more continuous, CoreWeave is positioned to capture that compounding demand from the very customers driving the AI revolution. So far, that trend shows no signs of slowing. Expand NASDAQ : CRWV CoreWeave Today's Change ( 7.47 %) $ 9.21 Current Price $ 132.55 Key Data Points Market Cap $66B Day's Range $ 125.99 - $ 133.06 52wk Range $ 33.52 - $ 187.00 Volume 21M Avg Vol 28M Gross Margin 49.73 % Dividend Yield N/A 2. Expanding into new industries and verticals The second major growth vector comes from broadening CoreWeave's customer base beyond AI labs and hyperscalers . So far, much of its revenue has been concentrated in a handful of AI training workloads. But the next wave of adoption is coming from industries that are just beginning to deploy large-scale compute -- from financial modelling and pharmaceutical research to gaming, design, and industrial simulation. As generative AI applications proliferate, more enterprises will need access to high-performance GPU clusters -- without building data centers from scratch. This AI compute is CoreWeave's sweet spot. Its model allows it to provision GPU compute on demand, with lower latency and often better price-performance ratios than the hyperscalers. While most of CoreWeave's revenue still comes from AI labs and hyperscalers, it is also making progress in expanding into new verticals. For instance, it announced that it would acquire Monolith AI, a pioneer in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve complex physics and engineering challenges. This acquisition will allow CoreWeave to offer a full-stack platform for industrial and manufacturing enterprises. If CoreWeave can replicate its success with OpenAI in just a few of these industries, the growth runway could extend for many years into the future. 3. Strengthening its moat through vertical integration Another transformative pillar of CoreWeave's growth strategy is vertical integration -- controlling more of the physical and operational infrastructure that underpins its cloud. The company's planned acquisition of Core Scientific , a large data-center and power operator, marks a significant step in that direction. The deal gives CoreWeave direct control over critical bottlenecks such as energy and data center capacity. Owning this layer reduces dependency on third-party hosting providers and mitigates the risk of power shortages or cost spikes. It also allows CoreWeave to expand faster and with better long-term economics: Every dollar of capital expenditures (capex) spent now builds durable assets that can serve multiple generations of GPUs. Beyond physical infrastructure, CoreWeave is investing in orchestration software and automation tools to maximize GPU utilization. By controlling both the hardware and software layers, it can improve efficiency, reduce idle time, and ultimately enhance margins. In short, vertical integration isn't just about scale, but also sustainability. It gives CoreWeave the control and resilience it needs to keep growing through the next decade of AI expansion. What does it mean for investors? CoreWeave is riding on one of the biggest trends in decades -- and is smartly taking advantage of it. By deepening relationships with its anchor clients, expanding into new verticals, and owning more of the stack, CoreWeave is building a foundation that could support exponential revenue growth for years. For investors, that makes CoreWeave a fascinating growth stock to watch -- and potentially, an investment opportunity. Lawrence Nga has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Moderna Announces Phase 3 Study of Investigational Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine Did Not Meet Primary Efficacy Endpoint ACCESS Newswire · Moderna, Inc. Moderna, Inc. Wed, October 22, 2025 at 4:05 PM EDT 4 min read In this article: MRNA META Company to discontinue development of mRNA-1647 in congenital CMV Company will continue to evaluate mRNA-1647 in ongoing Phase 2 trial in bone marrow transplant patients Company does not anticipate any impact to its 2025 financial guidance or its expectation of achieving breakeven in 2028 CAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESS Newswire / October 22, 2025 / Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) today announced topline results from a Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the efficacy of mRNA-1647, the Company's investigational cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine. The study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of preventing CMV infection in seronegative female participants of childbearing age (16-40 years of age). Moderna will discontinue its congenital CMV clinical development program. \"Today's announcement is disappointing for families and healthcare professionals who have been eagerly awaiting a CMV vaccine to prevent congenital CMV, a leading infectious cause of birth defects,\" said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. \"The majority of the data from this trial is still forthcoming, and we will share our full results with the scientific community in hopes that our learnings can contribute to the continued pursuit of a CMV vaccine. I am grateful for our dedicated team, our partners at clinical trial sites, and all the trial participants who made this research possible.\" The Phase 3 trial ( NCT05085366 ) was a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study included approximately 7,500 women 16-40 years of age from approximately 300 sites across 13 countries, representing the largest trial assessing the efficacy of a CMV vaccine to-date. Vaccine efficacy against primary CMV infection in healthy women was well below the Company's target, ranging from 6% to 23% depending on the case definition used. \"We are clearly disappointed by the failure to prevent primary infection because it means there is still no vaccine for the prevention of congenital CMV despite the many decades of work by the field,\" said Stephen Hoge, MD, President of Moderna. \"CMV does cause significant disease in other contexts, including reactivation of the latent virus in those undergoing bone marrow transplantation, and we will continue to explore the potential of mRNA-1647 to suppress disease associated with reactivation in those high-risk patients through our ongoing Phase 2 study.\" mRNA-1647 was found to be generally well-tolerated regardless of CMV serostatus, with a safety profile consistent with earlier studies. No safety concerns have been raised by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The Company plans to continue its study of mRNA-1647 in bone marrow transplant patients, which is currently in a Phase 2 trial ( NCT05683457 ). Story Continues Moderna does not anticipate any impact to its 2025 financial guidance or its expectation of achieving breakeven in 2028. Moderna anticipated minimal initial revenue contribution from mRNA-1647 given necessary investments in market building and launch, and expected the product to be cash-flow negative in 2028.

Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25% drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years. Most Read from Bloomberg Pritzker Slams Chicago Mayor’s Plan for Tax on Big Payrolls Cruise Ships Show South Korea’s Struggle to Host Global Leaders MTA to Sell $230 Million of Debt Amid Tolling Plan Legal Fight WATCH: What to watch for in Tesla earnings. Source: Bloomberg What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1% Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close. “The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group. This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co. The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times. Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a $7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September. Story Continues After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter. “Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterize it.” Tesla representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment. Expectations for Tesla’s earnings are falling too. Analysts now project it will post a profit of $1.75 a share for 2025, down from $2.66 a share just six months back. The consensus revenue estimate has fallen by 12% over the same period. That Tesla’s stock price is racing ahead and giving the company such a lofty market valuation isn’t necessarily a problem. It’s been here before. The difference is that when the shares previously acted like this the company was significantly smaller. This kind of extreme valuation is far less common among businesses of Tesla’s current size. It has a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, while Palantir is worth $430 billion, Warner Brothers Discovery’s market cap is less than $50 billion, and Boeing is at around $160 billion as of Tuesday’s close. Compared to other automakers Tesla’s valuation is even further out of line. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. both have price-to-earnings multiples in the single digits. “The market clearly looks at it as something more than a car company,” said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. “However, it is at the end of the day, a car company. It would be interestingly easier for me to value if the company was a pure play AI company.” The difference is that the market’s longest-running AI darling, Nvidia, is expected to post 50% profit growth this year. And other mega-caps are projected to report annual earnings growth ranging from the high single digits to the mid-teens. “While names like Microsoft and Nvidia are monetizing AI today, Tesla’s valuation is anchored in what it might become with autonomy and robotics,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Financial. “That gap between vision and execution is what will define its next leg.” Top Tech Stories Anthropic PBC is in discussions with Alphabet Inc.’s Google about a deal that would provide the artificial intelligence company with additional computing power valued in the high tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple Inc.’s iPhone Air went on sale in China on Wednesday, eliciting a subdued consumer response in the world’s biggest smartphone arena. OpenAI unveiled its first artificial intelligence-powered web browser, putting the ChatGPT maker in competition on a new front with Alphabet Inc.’s Google. A new mixed-reality headset developed by Samsung Electronics Co. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google has hit the market for about half the price of Apple Inc.’s $3,499 Vision Pro — the product it mostly closely resembles and will directly compete against. Apple Inc.’s effort to reinvent the iPad by adding a giant foldable screen has hit development hurdles, potentially delaying the planned launch.

(NEE): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Wed, October 22, 2025 at 2:30 PM EDT 3 min read In this article: NEE-PS NEE-PT NEE AMZN GOOGL We came across a bullish thesis on NextEra Energy, Inc. on Paradox’s Substack by PARADOX INTELLIGENCE. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on NEE. NextEra Energy, Inc.'s share was trading at $80.06 as of October 3rd. NEE’s trailing and forward P/E were 27.24 and 20.04 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. 10 Companies That Will Benefit From Global Warming The company is the largest U.S. renewable operator, with over 60 GW of solar and wind capacity and a 6 GW data center backlog, positioning it as a key provider for hyperscalers seeking to meet ESG commitments. Its portfolio benefits from long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with major tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, creating stable demand despite the inherent intermittency of renewable generation. The company delivered a strong Q2 2025 performance, reporting EPS of $1.05, above expectations, and projects an 8–10% EPS CAGR, while trading at a 20x forward P/E with a 2.6% dividend yield. A $64–72 billion capital expenditure program through 2025 underlines its commitment to scaling capacity and supporting hyperscaler demand. While the business is well-positioned for long-term growth, it faces significant risks, including the need for grid-scale storage to manage intermittency, transmission constraints, and policy sensitivity as federal renewable incentives and tax credits sunset. This policy risk could impact near-term economics and the relative competitiveness of renewable generation versus baseload sources under the current regulatory framework. Nevertheless, the company’s market leadership, deep hyperscaler relationships, and scale in solar and wind provide a structural growth story. With its capital program advancing and a de-risked financial profile, the stock offers an attractive risk/reward profile for investors seeking exposure to the accelerating energy transition. The combination of stable contracted demand, expansion opportunities, and potential policy tailwinds in the longer term creates a compelling investment case, even as near-term execution and regulatory challenges require careful monitoring. Previously we covered a bullish thesis on PG&E Corporation (PCG) by Acid Investments in February 2025, which highlighted the market overreaction to the Los Angeles wildfires, PG&E’s lack of direct liability, and strong 2025 EPS guidance of $1.50 with 10% projected growth. The company's stock price has been flat since our coverage. The thesis still stands as fundamentals and risk mitigation remain solid. PARADOX INTELLIGENCE shares a similar perspective but emphasizes renewable growth and hyperscaler PPAs as key drivers for NextEra Energy, differentiating it from PG&E’s wildfire-focused thesis. Story Continues NextEra Energy, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds . As per our database, 66 hedge fund portfolios held NEE at the end of the second quarter which was 75 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(AP) — Meta Platforms is cutting roughly 600 artificial intelligence jobs even as it continues to hire more workers for its superintelligence lab, the company confirmed on Wednesday. Axios first reported the cuts, which will affect Meta’s Fundamental AI Research, or FAIR unit, as well as product-related AI and AI infrastructure units. Its newer TBD Lab unit won’t be affected. Citing a memo sent to workers by chief AI officer Alexandr Wang , Axios said the company is encouraging employees affected to apply for other jobs at Meta, with most expected to find other roles. The Menlo Park, California-based company is also still recruiting and hiring for TBD Lab, which is developing Meta's latest large language models. Large language models are the technology behind OpenAI ’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini — and Meta’s Llama. Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it’s also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

REUTERS/Yves Herman · Reuters Reuters Wed, October 22, 2025 at 1:44 PM EDT 2 min read In this article: META OWL (Reuters) -Meta is cutting around 600 positions out of the several thousand roles in its Superintelligence Labs, the Facebook owner said on Wednesday as it looks to make its artificial intelligence unit more flexible and responsive. The job cuts will affect Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit, as well as teams focused on product-related AI and AI infrastructure, the company said. The newly formed TBD Lab, which comprises \"a few dozen\" researchers and engineers developing Meta's next-generation foundation models, will not be affected. Axios first reported the job cuts announcement, citing a company memo. Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang said fewer team members would streamline decision-making and increase the responsibility, scope and impact of each role. The company said it was encouraging affected employees to apply for other jobs within Meta. Meta on Tuesday struck a $27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital, the company's largest-ever private capital agreement, to fund its biggest data center project. Some analysts said the deal will allow Meta to achieve its massive AI ambitions by shifting much of the upfront cost and risk to external capital, while retaining a smaller ownership share in the project. The parent of Facebook and Instagram reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs in June after senior staff departures and a poor reception for its open-source Llama 4 model. CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally led an aggressive hiring spree for the unit to revitalize Meta's AI efforts. Superintelligence Labs includes Meta's foundations, product and FAIR teams as well as TBD Lab that is focused on developing the company's next generation of AI models. The company began investing in AI in 2013 by launching FAIR unit and recruiting Yann LeCun, its chief AI scientist, to lead the effort and building a global research network focused on deep learning.

Tracey Ryniec Wed, October 22, 2025 at 1:24 PM EDT 4 min read In this article: NVDA Earnings season is rolling on and the Magnificent 7 stocks, minus NVIDIA which reported earnings a few weeks ago, are in the spotlight. Some are calling the Mag 7 stocks “defensive plays.” But are they? None are classic value stocks with low price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. But all of them are trillion-dollar companies in diverse industries that have become a staple of modern life. Two Mag 7 Companies Are Earnings All-Stars Two of the six have great earnings surprise track records and are earnings all-stars with just 1 miss in the last 5 years. It’s not easy, even for a Mag 7 stock, to beat nearly every quarter for 5 years. If it’s not the pandemic, it’s the emergence of new technologies like the AI Revolution, that can trip up even the best companies. Who has the best chart among the Mag 7 stocks soon to report earnings? It’s a close call in October 2025. The Best Charts of the Mag 7 Stocks 1. Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ) Tesla will be the first to report earnings on Oct 22, 2025. However, it has the worst earnings surprise track record out of the Mag 7. Tesla has only beat 2 out of the last 4 quarters, but it is coming off a beat last quarter. Shares of Tesla have rebounded this year and are up 17.6% year-to-date. It’s not cheap. Tesla is trading with a forward P/E of 270 with a P/S ratio of 15. A P/S ratio over 10 is considered expensive. Earnings are expected to fall 32.6% this year. It would be the third year in a row Tesla’s earnings have declined. Is the Street pricing in a turnaround in Tesla in 2026? 2. Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) Microsoft is an earnings all-star. It has only missed one time in the last 5 years, and it was in 2022. That’s impressive. Microsoft is expected to grow earnings by 12.9% this fiscal year and another 16.1% next year. However, it’s P/S ratio is still stretched, at 13.5. Shares of Microsoft are up 23.5% year-to-date. Is Microsoft the top chart out of the Mag 7 stocks? 3. Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) Alphabet has missed on earnings 4 times in the last 5 years, in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Shares of Alphabet are hitting new all-time highs again heading into this earnings report. Earnings are expected to jump 23.6% in 2025. Alphabet is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 25. Alphabet shares are up 35.5% year-to-date. Forget Microsoft, is Alphabet the true winner among these stocks? 4. Meta Platforms, Inc. ( META ) Story Continues Meta Platforms has missed just 3 times in the last 5 years, all of the misses in 2022. It has beat on earnings 11 quarters in a row. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 21.7% year-to-date. It is expected to grow earnings this year by 18%. But it’s not cheap. Meta Platforms has a P/S ratio of 10.1. A P/S over 10 means a company is expensive. Is Meta Platforms the Mag 7 stock that few are talking about in 2025? 5. Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) Apple has a great earnings surprise record. It has only missed one time in the last 5 years, and it was in 2023. Apple shares have broken out to another new all-time high as the earnings date approaches. Earnings are expected to be up 9% in 2025 and another 6.7% in 2026. It’s not cheap. Apple has a forward P/E of 32. Could Apple have the best chart of the Mag 7 stocks? What else should you know about the Mag 7 Stocks? Amazon is the worst performer of all the Mag 7 stocks this year. Shares are down 2.4% year-to-date. But it’s also the cheapest on a P/S ratio basis. Amazon’s P/S ratio is just 3.4. While that’s not a value P/S ratio under 1.0, it’s still the cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks. Make sure you tune into the video to have all your questions about the Mag 7 stocks answered.

Aniruddha Ganguly Wed, October 22, 2025 at 1:22 PM EDT 3 min read In this article: RDDT SNAP META Meta Platforms META has been constantly adding features across its platforms to boost user engagement. The company’s focus on integrating AI into its platforms — Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Threads — is expected to help the company add new users. Expanding user base (3.48 billion daily users at the end of the second quarter of 2025) and growing engagement level are expected to boost advertising revenues, which jumped 21.5% year over year to $46.56 billion and accounted for 98% of second-quarter 2025 revenues. META is frequently introducing new features across its platforms to drive more conversation and user engagement. Meta AI’s growing capabilities have been a key catalyst. It can now translate, dub, and lip sync reels on Facebook and Instagram, which helps users to enjoy reels from around the world. Translations are now available in English, Spanish, Hindi and Portuguese, with more language support in the future. META is set to leverage user interaction with Meta AI to personalize the content and ads users see, including posts and reels. Meanwhile, Threads users can now attach up to 10,000 characters of text to a post, and any text attached can be read directly in the app. For Instagram, META has launched several new features and tools like repost, interactive map and Friends tab in Reels. Meta Platforms has been adding new features to Facebook. The company recently bought back the jobs tool on the platform. Users can search for new jobs through a dedicated tab in Marketplace. Job listings will also appear across Groups and Pages. Meta Platforms has made finding and sharing reels easier on Facebook by upgrading the recommendations engine and AI-powered suggestions. META recently rolled out a new Facebook feature that makes it easier for users to recall and share photos and videos, and suggest edits and collages. Our model estimate for 2025 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $190.28 billion, indicating 18.5% growth over the figure reported in 2024. META Faces Tough Competition in Social Networking Space Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from the likes of Reddit RDDT and Snap SNAP in the social networking space. Reddit is benefiting from strong growth in user engagement, including rising daily and weekly active users, ARPU gains and the expansion of advertiser tools such as Dynamic Product Ads, Reddit Pixel and Conversion API. In the second quarter of 2025, Reddit’s advertising revenues increased 84% year over year to $465 million, driven by both existing advertisers deepening their investments and a 50% rise in the active advertiser count. Snap’s advertising platform is evolving with commerce-driven ad volume growing 39% year over year in the second quarter, and newer ad formats such as Sponsored Snaps are delivering stronger conversion outcomes. With campaign tools improving measurability and efficiency, Snap is seeing broader advertiser adoption. Snap continues to evolve as a visual-first social media platform with strong traction among Gen Z users. Its global user base continues to expand, reaching 469 million Daily Active Users during the second quarter of 2025, up 8.6% year over year.

Citi Head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert comes on Market Catalysts to talk about how his team is analyzing AI growth. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts . Video Transcript 00:00 Julie And Scott, I know your team has also written about um applying what you call the the GARP overlay on AI, right? Growth at a reasonable price, which I've been amusing myself by thinking of it as AARP, AI at a reasonable pro price. 00:15 Julie But how do you find? I mean like is there where do you find that at this point? 00:22 Scott Julie, I'm much closer to the AARP connection than you are, but uh so let's be clear on that. Um, you know, essentially what it comes down to is is this notion of what's 00:36 Scott being implied in the stock price right now, relative to where consensus is. And so when we look down our list of companies, this is where we get go with this growth at a reasonable price. We find companies that are selling at peg ratios that are fairly consistent with overall market averages. I'll give you an example. The mag 7 in aggregate right now is at a peg ratio. So this is PE to growth of about two times. 01:03 Scott That's about the same as for the other 493. So what's happening here is the market is fairly efficiently pricing in current growth expectations. Now, they're going to be certain companies that don't have an underlying earnings component. They're still very early in their life cycle. Those are a little bit different. But the tried and true companies that are generating positive earnings, positive free cash, that are contributing to this AI infrastructure build, generally speaking are still in pretty decent shape in terms of again, underlying growth, justifying where the valuations are at this point.

The annual Davos gathering of political leaders, top executives and celebrities runs from January 20 to 24. Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images | Image Credits:Hollie Adams/Bloomberg / Getty Images Meta’s chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, wrote in a memo to staff on Wednesday that the company will cut about 600 jobs from its superintelligence lab, according to a report from Axios. Meta declined to comment, but told TechCrunch that Axios’ reporting is accurate. As Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other companies race to build the most powerful AI systems, Meta had a busy summer on the hiring front. The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages , though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that “none of [OpenAI’s] best people” took the offers. “By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in the memo to staff. This line of thinking tracks with Meta’s recent “year of efficiency” — a more sanitized way to describe the company’s mass layoffs . At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that “leaner is better.” Now, it seems that Meta isn’t lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts. The company claims that most of these people impacted today should be able to find another job within Meta. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Artificial intelligence has enhanced many industries, but it's also leaving some companies behind, including a production company that specializes in content. A small business owner expressed dissatisfaction about AI slop slowing down their business on Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ). The company has only signed two big clients and hasn't had any small or medium-sized clients. \"It appears the entire middle market got destroyed by AI slop,\" the business owner said. \"You are underestimating the magnitude of this.\" Don't Miss: Amazon and NVIDIA Partnered With This Robot Chef — Now Individual Investors Can Too Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property Creator Jobs May Face More Turbulence One Redditor was concise and didn't hold any punches when describing how AI may hurt the creator economy even more. The commenter emphasized that consumers want a result and don't care how it is achieved. \"Whether it’s done by some struggling artist who puts 40 hours into a piece, versus an AI generated output that’s created in 30 seconds, it’s all the same to the consumer as long as it’s passable to fulfill their need,\" the commenter said. It can explain why many people have been watching AI-produced videos or reading articles that were produced by AI. \"Some of the grown adults I work with watch it all day long and can’t seem to get enough,\" one commenter said. The same commenter who said that consumers won't care too much if their videos are produced by creators or AI in the future also suggested that students take a closer look at what they're learning in college. \"I think it’s inevitable that many of these creator jobs are going to become obsolete, and young people should give a good, hard look at what they study in university now more than ever,\" the commenter said. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ? AI Slop Continues To Get Better Artificial intelligence isn't as good as the best creators, but it's getting better over time. Multiple entrepreneurs brought up that AI is still in its early innings and that it will only get better from here. \"AI slop is quickly getting much better and it is the worst it will ever be,\" one commenter said. \"Don't think things are going to go back.\" Several business owners complained about how addictive AI slop has become, with some users saying they want to \"stay off of Facebook entirely\" and \"throw [their] phones away.\" Story Continues The desire among some business owners to pivot away from social media demonstrates that there are people who are tired of AI slop and want more personalized experiences. This group of consumers can present an opportunity for business owners, even if it isn't content creators who capitalize on this segment. See Also: The ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.81/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In Personalization Can Help Content Creators Stand Out There's a desire among some people to reduce the amount of AI content on the web. \"Can't stand AI content,\" one business owner said. \"It’s rapidly making me not want to use the internet.\" However, people don't want to consume poorly-produced content just because a human produced it. This setup may present an opportunity for the best content creators who continue to refine their craft and become excellent storytellers. Anyone can use ChatGPT to find a bunch of tips on how to do something, but ChatGPT can't tell a personalized story. Personalization is one of the few strengths content creators have over technology that can outproduce them 24/7. Having a stand-out business has also become more important, since it's easy to use AI slop to copy the copycats. \"AI Slop doesn’t beat an Anime Cosplay Cafe with [trading card game] tournaments, costume design supplies, maid cafe events, lock-in raves for the kiddos, and more,\" one business owner said. \"But it definitely beats content creators who repeat the same activities that got them viral until the audience has completely lost interest.

      "text": "Meta Platforms (META) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth Zacks Equity Research Wed, October 22, 2025 at 10:00 AM EDT 4 min read In this article: META The market expects Meta Platforms (META) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 29, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This social media company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.3%. Revenues are expected to be $49.38 billion, up 21.7% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.16% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for META Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Meta Platforms? For Meta Platforms, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.72%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1. So, this combination indicates that Meta Platforms will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Meta Platforms would post earnings of $5.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.14, delivering a surprise of +22.47%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Meta Platforms appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

      "text": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock(s) to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now -- Including Nvidia (NVDA) Stock By Selena Maranjian – Oct 22, 2025 at 9:30AM Key Points Each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has grown huge -- recently worth more than $1 trillion. Several of the seven are reasonably to attractively valued right now despite rapid this growth. Facebook, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms all offer a compelling growth proposition today. NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Market Cap $4.5T Today's Change angle-down ( 2.26 %) $ 4.13 Current Price $ 186.28 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:59 PM ET One of these stocks has been growing at an average annual rate of nearly 75% over the past decade. You know the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks, right? They're Google parent Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Facebook parent Meta Platforms ( META +0.64% ) , Microsoft ( MSFT +0.56% ) , Nvidia ( NVDA +2.26% ) , and Tesla . The companies are magnificent, in part, because of their rapid growth rates, and many investors who don't own them are likely wishing they did. Fortunately, if you're one of those folks, it's not too late to invest in some Magnificent Seven stocks. Here's a look at three that are reasonably valued at recent levels. Image source: Getty Images. Magnificent growth One of the most magnificent things about these companies is how rapidly they've grown -- to enormous sizes. Check it out: Stock Market Capitalization (in trillions) 10-Year Average Annual Growth Rate Alphabet $3.1 21.9% Amazon $2.3 22.4% Apple $3.7 24.9% Meta Platforms $1.8 22.1% Microsoft $3.8 27.4% Nvidia $4.5 74.5% Tesla $1.5 39.7% That's right, each of them was recently valued in the market at more than $1 trillion -- and, often, a lot more. Each of them has been growing at an average annual rate of more than 20% over the past decade, too. Despite all this growth, the following members of the cohort seem reasonably valued. 1. Nvidia Nvidia ( NVDA +2.26% ) , a leading semiconductor company, might be the one stock out of the seven that you'd most like to own, given its recent torrid growth rate. (Remember though that past performance isn't a guarantee of future performance!) You might be happy to learn that it's one of the more reasonably priced stocks in the bunch, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29, well below the five-year average of 39. Expand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( 2.26 %) $ 4.13 Current Price $ 186.28 Key Data Points Market Cap $4526B Day's Range $ 183.51 - $ 187.47 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 195.62 Volume 5.1M Avg Vol 173M Gross Margin 69.85 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % The company was once known for its gaming chips, but now it's not only a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for games, but also in chips for data centers . And data centers are booming, as much of our artificial intelligence (AI) activity runs through them. This all suggests that Nvidia has a lot more room to grow . Don't buy into the stock before reading up on it, though, because it does have some competition , from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom . 2. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms ( META +0.64% ) is the parent company of Facebook, and one of Facebook's most amazing features is its scope. Consider this: In a world that was recently home to 8.1 billion people, each of Meta Platforms' main platforms -- Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- recently boasted more than 3 billion active monthly users. Students of business might salivate at such numbers, because if Meta can monetize just a small fraction of them a little more than it already does -- such as by better targeting ads to consumers -- that will be some serious money. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.17 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 662K Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Like most of the Magnificent Seven, Meta Platforms has been investing heavily in AI -- to the tune of tens of billions of dollars -- building data centers and custom AI hardware . For example, it's aiming to build its own AI accelerator chips , which would compete with those of Nvidia. Meanwhile, its digital advertising business is still generating gobs of cash. (Remember how powerful it can be to generate money from a massive user base.) Meta's stock seems reasonably valued to somewhat overvalued, with a recent forward P/E ratio of 24 only a bit above the five-year average of 21. Your assessment of that valuation should take into account how confident you are in the company's ability to keep growing briskly. 3. Microsoft Then there's Microsoft ( MSFT +0.56% ) , home to the dominant Office 365 suite of applications, the Azure cloud computing platform, the Xbox gaming platform, the Windows operating system, and even LinkedIn, among many other things. Its Copilot virtual AI assistant is accessible in multiple Microsoft products, and the company hopes that millions of its Office 365 subscribers will pay up for the paid Copilot add-on . Expand NASDAQ : MSFT Microsoft Today's Change ( 0.56 %) $ 2.93 Current Price $ 523.49 Key Data Points Market Cap $3892B Day's Range $ 520.76 - $ 525.35 52wk Range $ 344.79 - $ 555.45 Volume 681K Avg Vol 20M Gross Margin 68.82 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % The company is growing well, with fourth-quarter revenue up 18% year over year and net income up 22% -- and CEO Satya Nadella noting, \"Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector. ... We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.\" Microsoft is a dividend-paying stock , too, with a recent dividend yield of 0.71%. That may not seem like much, but it's been growing briskly. The total annual dividend payout was recently $3.32 per share, up from $2.54 in 2022 and $1.89 in 2019. The company's stock is reasonably valued, as well, with a recent forward P/E of 33 a bit above the five-year average of 30. Take a closer look at any of these companies that interest you.

You can read today's AWS here >>> Cornucopia of Q3 Earnings: GE, GM & More Today's Featured Research Reports Apple's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (+12% vs. +11.8%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. AAPL now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. Both paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025. Apple TV+ viewership soared double-digit year over year. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the September quarter's (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. AAPL expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter. However, gross margin is expected to be 46-47% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, including a tariff impact of $1.1 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors. (You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> ) Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+25.2% vs. +19%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.48 billion people daily. Meta Platforms' growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern. (You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>> ) JPMorgan's shares have gained +28.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry's gain of +30.3%. The company's shares prices are driven by continued operational strength. Its third-quarter 2025 results reflected strong capital markets performance. Business expansion efforts, loan demand and changes in interest rates will drive net interest income (NII). While normal deal-making activity is tied to the economy's health, the bank's solid pipeline and leadership position have generated continued growth in the investment banking (IB) business thus far. Its enhanced capital distributions seem sustainable. At the same time, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates may hurt fee income. As it invests in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain elevated. Weak asset quality due to a tough macroeconomic backdrop is a woe. (You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>> ) Shares of AstroNova have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the year-to-date period (-17.7% vs. +35.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $74.14 million is facing challenges, such as gross margin compression from inventory buildup (32.2% in Q2), ongoing volatility in the Product ID segment (-8.9% YoY revenue), stagnant Aerospace OEM sales, and weak cash conversion weigh on execution. With the stock trading at a deep discount to peers (0.59x EV/sales vs. 5.99x sub-industry), valuation is compelling. Nevertheless, AstroNova is repositioning for margin expansion and earnings growth via a strategic shift to higher-margin ToughWriter 640 printers, now 50% of Aerospace shipments and expected to exceed 80% by FY26-end. A $3M cost reduction program enhances operating leverage, while $4.5M in 1H FY26 free cash flow and reduced net debt strengthen financial flexibility. Proprietary printhead technology supports vertical integration, recurring revenues and supply chain control. FY26 guidance (revenue: $149-$154M, EBITDA margin: 7.5%-8.5%) signals confidence in a second-half recovery.

Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) is making one of its boldest infrastructure bets yet, teaming up with Blue Owl Capital ( NYSE:OWL ) to finance and build the colossal Hyperion Data Center in Louisiana, a $27 billion project that ranks among Wall Street's largest private capital deals.

The two companies are forming a joint venture, with Blue Owl taking an 80% stake and Meta holding the rest. Once completed, the Hyperion campus will stretch across 4 million square feet and create about 500 jobs. Blue Owl is contributing $7 billion in equity, while Meta will pocket a one-time $3 billion payout as part of the agreement. Some of Blue Owl's funding comes from debt arranged through PIMCO and other investors, with Morgan Stanley ( NYSE:MS ) advising Meta on the deal. Meta CFO Susan Li called the project a bold step forward, saying it blends Meta's deep experience running world-class data centers with Blue Owl's infrastructure muscle. It's a key part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's $65 billion plan to supercharge Meta's AI computing capacity, targeting 1GW of power and 1.3 million GPUs by year-end.

      "text": "Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Now Zacks Equity Research Wed, October 22, 2025 at 9:00 AM EDT 2 min read Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important. Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises. 2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure. Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Meta Platforms (META) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.77 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on October 29, 2025. Meta Platforms' Earnings ESP sits at +2.72%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.77 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.59. META is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Intel (INTC) . Intel is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 23, 2025. INTC's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.01 a share one day from its next earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Intel is $0, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +116.67%. META and INTC's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon. Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Beyond Meat (BYND) surges over 50% in a short squeeze, but fundamentals remain weak and valuation reflects ongoing turnaround challenges. AT&T (T) outperforms on subscriber growth, especially in fiber and postpaid phones, signaling core wireless strength despite mixed financials.

(0:16) Beyond Meat on a wild squeeze ride . (1:04) Meta laying off 600 superintelligence employees. (2:26) This is an abridged transcript of the podcast: Our top story so far, spot gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and silver ( XAGUSD:CUR ) remain under pressure following a historic one-day drop. Silver is now trading in correction territory, down more than 10% from its recent intraday highs. Gold is down around 8%. Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy, says a very technical extended rally has traders focused on protecting gains rather than chasing new highs. The latest price action also underlines how silverâs liquidity is roughly nine times lower than gold, magnifying both rallies and corrections, he added. Meanwhile, Spartan Capitalâs Peter Cardillo says that the selloff looks more like a âhealthy pullbackâ than the start of a serious correction. Both metals are off their lows and have a chance to move into the green by the end of the trading day. Among active stocks, Beyond Meat ( BYND ) to infinity and beyond? The stock is seeing short squeeze/meme stock action, rallying another 50% today after soaring nearly 150% Tuesday. Shorts look to be racing to cover, with open short interest north of 50% on the stock. SA analyst Joseph Parrish says the rally has little to do with fundamentals, as \"BYND's valuation now fully reflects its difficult turnaround prospect.\" AT&T ( T ) beat expectations for key subscriber metrics in Q3 , which helped investors overlook profit that only met expectations and a miss on revenue. The company added 288,000 fiber subscribers, ahead of the Bloomberg consensus estimate of nearly 274,000. Wireless postpaid phone net adds of 405,000 echoed that strength, comfortably ahead of the 331,000 estimate. Danil Sereda, Investing Group Leader for Beyond the Wall Investing, said the strong postpaid phone net adds and low churn in mobility services, along with a rise in mobility service revenues, means continued core wireless strength. And Texas Instruments ( T XN) is slumping after mixed Q3 results and weaker outlook drew lukewarm reactions from analysts. Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis says he plans to continue watching from the sidelines, given the relative valuation of the stock vs. \"the least amount of cyclical recovery left in the group.\" In other news of note, Meta Platforms (ME T A) is slashing around 600 jobs at its superintelligence unit for more agility and less bureaucracy. In a memo seen by Axios, new AI chief Alexandr Wang says after the cuts \"fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load bearing and have more scope and impact.\" The layoffs will come in the company's Fundamental AI Research lab and its product-related AI and AI infrastructure units but will spare the TBD Lab unit. And affected employees will be invited to apply for other roles within Meta. And in the Wall Street Research Corner, Goldman Sachs expects companies to keep channeling the bulk of their cash toward capital expenditures and research and development in 2026. The equity team's forecasts imply 50% of S&P 500 ( SP500 ) cash spending will go to capex and R&D, 43% to buybacks and dividends and 7% to cash M&A. Information Technology ( XLK ) names are among the biggest spenders. The top names in Goldmanâs Capex & R&D Basket (ranked by capex + R&D divided by market cap) are: Intel (IN T C) at 27%, Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) at 16%, Micron Technology ( MU ) at 12%, Akamai ( AKAM ) at 9% and Oracle ( ORCL ) at 8%.

The letter is available for download here .  AI stocks remain the favorite topic of Wall Street in the third quarter. In the third quarter, Wedgewood Composite’s net return was 5.9% compared to the Standard & Poor’s 8.1%, the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 10.5%, and the Russell 1000 Value Index’s 5.3% return for the same period. In addition, you can check the fund’s best 5 holdings to know its best picks in 2025. In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners highlighted stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc.

While the stock was not a top performer during the quarter, it has been a top performer year to date. The Company finished 2024 with over $200 billion in gross property plant and equipment and capitalized leases, up $135 billion from five years earlier. Yet it managed to take annual gross cash lows from $29 billion in 2019 to $82 billion in 2024. These capex investments have yielded astonishingly returns. The Company has been cloud-native for over a decade and also incepted one of the most important software libraries used by most AI labs today (PyTorch). The hardware and software infrastructure ecosystem within Meta Platforms and the returns on those investments have proven that Meta is hardly speculative with its large long-term spending plans.\" Meta Platforms, Inc.

      "text": "Can a startup be worth a trillion dollars? Allie Garfinkle Wed, October 22, 2025 at 7:11 AM EDT 5 min read In this article: OPAI.PVT UBER AAPL META NVDA Sometime in August, my editor and I became interested in a question that turned out to be less controversial than expected: Will we ever see trillion-dollar startups? I’ve now asked dozens of people this question and the answer, almost unanimously, has been some version of “Yes, look at OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation.” It’s a remarkable state of affairs when you consider that as recently as August 2018, the planet’s most valuable startup was Uber, with a measly $76 billion valuation, and there were exactly zero public companies with trillion-dollar market caps. Apple was the first to grab the trillion-dollar ring in August 2018 (on Tuesday, the iPhone maker’s market cap reached $4 trillion), and Meta , Nvidia , Microsoft , Alphabet , and Tesla have since followed suit. So, assuming a trillion-dollar privately-held startup really is just a matter of time, there are a number of questions that we probably need to start asking, including what it means for the exit-based VC model and for founders, what it means for public-company focused regulation and disclosure rules (especially given efforts to open retirement plans to private assets), and of course, what the heck do we even call these things? Calling a company that large a startup is, of course, a bit of a misnomer, as Bessemer partner Talia Goldberg points out: “Calling a trillion dollar company a ‘startup’ is an exercise in branding,” she said via email. “It is a way for founders to keep the innovation narrative.” Goldberg also adds that the total valuation of the companies on Bessemer’s Cloud 100 list has grown by 10x over the last decade. Soon, she says, “the average private valuation will be $112 billion.” It does beg the question: 12 years after Aileen Lee coined the term to describe billion-dollar companies, what does “unicorn” even mean anymore? $1 billion startups are a dime a dozen these days. What’s needed is a term for the most rarefied breed, which, if the Term Sheet readers I’ve talked to are right, will soon be measured in thirteen digits. Samir Kumar, Touring Capital general partner, suggests the name “triceratops.” “If you think of triceratops you think of an unstoppable creature and brute force,” Kumar said via email. “Kind of like how trillion-dollar valuation startups will be created. Triceratops also went extinct.” Costonoa Ventures partner John Cowgill offers up “gigacorn,” while Felicis founder and managing partner Aydin Senkut likes “terracaps.” “‘Terra’ for trillion,” Senkut said. “It’s the next logical jump after unicorns and decacorns. At that scale, ‘startup’ doesn’t cut it. A terracap isn’t really a startup. It’s a sovereign economy with a cap table.” Story Continues My personal submission, for anyone wondering, is dragon. But perhaps my favorite suggestion: “At a trillion dollars, we’re going to have to call them Kaiju-corns!” Antonio Rodriguez, Matrix managing partner, said via email. “Because like the fabled monsters from the center of the Earth, they are big and strong and stomping all over the rest of the startup ecosystem.” There is, of course, an exit challenge if and when we finally see these Kaiju-corns, likely bolstering incentives to stay private in perpetuity. “If you’re investing in a startup worth a trillion dollars, what exit are you underwriting to? How is there any other exit besides going public?” wonders Touring’s Kumar. “And how many trillion-dollar startups will be able to put up the numbers to justify that valuation in the public markets? None of this is remotely close to being reasonable. Besides going public, probably the more realistic path is staying private (like SpaceX), and doing secondaries and tender offers to create liquidity for founders and early investors. That’s another very real path.” The few hundred words I’ve dropped on this aside, Sunil Dhaliwal, Amplify Partners GP, makes an important point: Anything that gets that big is definitionally anomalous. “We should give the unicorn metaphor a rest,” said Dhaliwal via email. “It served its purpose, but saying decacorn, centicorn, or kilocorn (is that what’s next?) has become meaningless. I’m not going to try to make fetch happen by coming up with a new catchy moniker. I think the bigger point is that while a few companies might reach this level, this is definitely not a category of companies anytime soon.” Then again, investor enthusiasm for private companies, particularly of the AI variety, does not seem to be slowing down. “The biggest delta we’ve ever seen now exists between private and public growth,” said Senkut via email. “The best private companies are growing at 400%, while the best publics struggle to hit 20%. Capital is going to go where the growth is. And right now, that’s private markets.” Fortune Term Sheet podcast hosted by Allie Garfinkle graphic with photo of Allie, links to YouTube video Term Sheet Podcast… This week’s guest: Oura CEO Tom Hale!

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A We're watching Meta, Starbucks and Reddit in today's top analyst calls with fresh notes out from Bank of America, UBS and City. Let's start with Meta. Bank of America reiterating its buy rating on the stock with a $900 price target, calling for another beat on both revenue and EPS when the company reports results next week. 00:23 Speaker A B of A expects Q3 sales of 50 billion and earnings of $7.30 a share, both above consensus, as Meta's AI powered ad engine keeps firing on all cylinders. 00:39 Speaker A Analysts see 23% year-over-year ad growth that's driven by better targeting, automation and new AI creative tools according to the firm. B of A also says that investors will be watching for updates on Meta's business AI platform and the return potential of its $600 billion US investment plan through 2028. 00:59 Speaker A Next up, Starbucks. UBS is staying neutral on the coffee chain and trimming its price target to $94 a share. That's down from the prior 100, saying it's still waiting for sales to perk up. 01:14 Speaker A The firm expects flat US same-store sales this quarter and operating margins around 10% as the company continues to pour money into labor and marketing tied to its green apron service model. UBS says the key question on the upcoming call will be whether management can lay out a timeline for a real turnaround in US traffic and transactions. 01:35 Speaker A Finally, Reddit. Shares are higher after City added the stock to its positive 90-day catalyst watch, maintaining a buy rating and raising its price target to 250 bucks from the prior 220. Analyst Ron Josie says he's upbeat on Reddit's growth and monetization plans, noting that partnerships with Google and Anthropic are boosting both traffic and revenue. 01:58 Speaker A City expects third quarter earnings on October 30th to come in significantly above expectations and says AI integrations like Reddit answers could keep daily user growth above 20% through year end. 02:10 Speaker A Keep it right here on Yahoo Finance.

      "text": "Analyst on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)-OpenAI Deal: ‘We Are Not As Worried About Circularity’ Fahad Saleem Tue, October 21, 2025 at 9:50 AM EDT 3 min read In this article: AMD OPAI.PVT NVDA META AVGO We recently published 10 Trending Stocks This Week . Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the trending stocks this week. Vivek Arya, senior semiconductor analyst at Bank of America Securities, said in a recent program on CNBC that he is bullish on AMD and other semiconductor companies amid rising demand for compute. Arya also said he is not “worried” about the apparent “circularity” of deals in the AI industry. “OpenAI is eating computing power like Pac-Man. You know, they have 800 million weekly active users, probably getting to a billion users by the end of the year. And this is within 3 years of them forming. It took Facebook 8 years to get to a billion users. And every one of the users that OpenAI has on their network is consuming a tremendous amount of tokens and computing capacity. So the company has to build out a lot of infrastructure, which it is doing with the help of cloud service providers, and for that it needs to partner with these leading semiconductor companies. Today, Nvidia is the incumbent. OpenAI has signed deals with Broadcom and now it has signed this deal with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD). But you know, it’s also important to realize the second point that OpenAI is going to be one of the many ecosystems that develops in this AI industry. You know, there’s going to be an ecosystem developed around Meta or Amazon or Google, right? The many different neoclouds that are forming. So this is going to be a broad, diversified industry with chip makers participating, which is why we are not as worried about the circularity of this. Because if you look at the total of the deals that OpenAI has signed with Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), they will probably end up being less than 5 or 10% of the overall deployment. So no, we are incredibly bullish about this buildout and I think companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and others are very well positioned to take advantage of it.” Analyst on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)-OpenAI Deal: ‘We Are Not As Worried About Circularity’ Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and manufactures semiconductors, including central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and other high-performance computing solutions for various markets like gaming, data centers, and AI. The company currently maintains a small market share for GPUs used for AI applications though by 2027, we believe the company will have product on par with the market leader, NVIDIA. Hyperscale customers with deep programming expertise may increasingly decide to dual-source high-end chips leading to much larger revenue and profit gains in coming years for AMD than investors currently expect.” Story Continues While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Investors showed less apprehension about the regional bank credit quality issue and were upbeat about the government shutdown possibly coming to an end. All three benchmark indexes finished in the green. How Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) climbed 1.1%, or 515.97 points, to close at 46,706.58. Twenty-five components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, four ended in negative, while one remained unchanged. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 310.57 points, or 1.4%, to close at 22,990.54. The S&P 500 gained 71.12 points, or 1.1%, to close at 6,735.13. Nine of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB), the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) advanced 1.2% each, while the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) fell 0.1%. The fear gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 12.3% to 18.23. A total of 17.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 20.2 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 4.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 3.34-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Tech Optimism Lifts Wall Street as Record AAPL Valuation Boosts Market On Monday, Apple Inc.’s AAPL stock added 3.9% to hit an all-time high, igniting optimism about the strength of consumer demand and the durability of corporate earnings. Robust early sales data for new technology products reassured investors that spending remained resilient despite higher borrowing costs. The company’s surge boosted overall market sentiment, lifting benchmark indexes and renewing hopes that the upcoming earnings season could exceed expectations. Gains in the tech sector also eased broader concerns about slowing growth, as investors interpreted the move as a sign of ongoing innovation-driven expansion. Consequently, shares of Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Meta Platforms, Inc. META jumped 3.3% and 2.1%, respectively. While NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), META has a #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Markets Gain as Shutdown Optimism Outweighs Bank Credit Worries Investors brushed aside concerns about regional bank credit issues on Monday, interpreting them as isolated challenges rather than signs of broader financial instability. Recent reports indicated that most mid-sized lenders did not have a capitalization issue and remained liquid, even as some increased provisions for commercial real estate loans. This reassured markets that any potential stress was contained. Story Continues At the same time, optimism grew that the government shutdown impasse in Washington was nearing resolution. White House adviser Kevin Hassett said that the 20-day government shutdown may end this week amid improving bipartisan negotiations in Congress. Investors anticipate restored policy stability and uninterrupted federal spending. The prospect of renewed government operations also meant fewer disruptions to economic data and public programs. With fears over banking risks fading and political tensions easing, major indexes advanced, reflecting renewed investor confidence in both financial stability and economic momentum.

More than 3,900 companies were affected and over 16 million people logged connection problems on Monday when Amazon Web Services (AWS) malfunctioned, according to Downdetector, which monitors websites going offline. The prolonged blackout surpassed a glitch last year involving Meta’s Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads platforms which led to 11 million reports. A computer error at Amazon’s vast data centres on the US East Coast caused chaos on Monday morning, rendering sites and apps such as Lloyds Bank, HMRC and Snapchat unusable. While many of the problems were resolved after around three hours, Amazon said it had not fully resolved the issue until shortly before midnight. Downdetector, the best-known website for monitoring web outages, tracks incidents through a combination of user reports, posts on social media and other signals such as increased visits to the website. It said it had received 1.5 million reports from the UK, the most from any country after the 6.3 million in the US. Snapchat received the most offline reports followed by AWS itself, Roblox and Amazon.com. Brent Ellis, a tech analyst at Forrester, said the episode showed how much consumers relied Amazon for internet access. “It highlights how concentration risk, a dangerously powerful yet routinely overlooked systemic risk, arises when so many companies across all industries become dependent on a single cloud provider and, more pertinently, a single region covered by that vendor,” he said. “There’s great appeal to using tech giants but assuming they are too big to fail or inherently resilient is a mistake, with the evidence being the current outage and past ones.” While the blackout was a record in terms of reports, the disruption was arguably less severe than an IT meltdown last year related to the security company CrowdStrike . The CrowdStrike bug last summer – which brought airlines, payment systems and train companies to a standstill – led to five million outage reports. The AWS glitch, which the company blamed on a problem with how sites and apps connect to its database system, affected smart home systems such as Ring security alarms, robot vacuums and a smart bed company. Eight Sleep, which sells a £3,000 smart mattress that adjusts temperature and tracks people’s sleep, said it had been affected by the outage. Some customers said they were unable to recline their beds because of the AWS crash. Terms and Privacy Policy Your privacy choices"

Aquila Partners with Samba TV to Advance Streaming Video Measurement for First-of-its-Kind Cross-media Platform Samba TV Tue, October 21, 2025 at 9:00 AM EDT 4 min read In this article: GOOGL META AMZN Samba TV Aquila will integrate Samba TV’s streaming viewership data with digital exposures from partners like Google, Meta, Amazon, and TikTok to provide true cross-platform measurement SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Samba TV, the global leader in AI-driven media intelligence, today announced a partnership with Aquila, a subsidiary of the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), to advance streaming video measurement within Aquila’s cross-media platform initiative. This partnership is a pivotal step toward building the industry's first advertiser-owned, independent measurement solution capable of deduplicating reach and frequency across streaming services, linear television, and major digital walled gardens. By integrating Samba TV’s rich first-party streaming viewership data into Aquila’s privacy-safe, marketer-led framework, the partnership will give advertisers an independent, objective view of their true audience reach across all major digital and television platforms, solving a long-standing challenge of audience fragmentation. For years, streaming TV has been a significant blind spot in cross-media measurement. Streaming viewership has grown 46% year-over-year, bolstered by ad-supported tiers at lower prices, making streaming an essential component of every modern media strategy. This partnership bridges that gap by integrating Samba TV’s unparalleled first-party streaming viewership data into Aquila’s platform, complementing existing data from Google, Meta, TikTok, and Amazon, as well as linear data from Comscore. “We are thrilled to join our friends at Aquila, which include some of the largest advertisers and media platforms, to crack the code of cross-platform measurement,” said Samba TV CEO and Co-founder Ashwin Navin. “Advertisers can no longer afford to measure media with currencies that treat streaming and digital as an afterthought to linear TV in their methodology. A cross-media view with a true streaming signal and collaboration with the biggest digital platforms in the world is a recipe for success. Samba provides a critical piece of the dataset that unlocks a uniquely holistic view that everyone has been waiting for.” The collaboration will progress through a multi-phase approach designed for precision and scalability. The first phase beginning in Q4 2025, focuses on data ingestion and integration. The full solution will provide live, campaign-level measurement capabilities, and is expected to be released in the second half of 2026. “Completing the cross-media measurement puzzle requires a best-in-class partner for every piece of the ecosystem,” said Aquila CEO Bill Tucker. “As we work to ensure Aquila encompasses as many advertisers and streaming platforms as possible, Samba TV was the clear choice to address the complexities of the streaming landscape. Their robust data and privacy-safe methodology are essential to our mission of offering advertisers the first truly deduplicated view of their reach across every major screen, from the smartphone to the living room TV.” Story Continues Aquila is the commercial venture in the U.S. market based on Project Halo, an open-source, transparent, privacy-centric and pro-competition framework proposed by WFA members and a community of stakeholders, including digital walled gardens. Aquila preserves Halo’s core innovations including privacy-preserving techniques such as secure multi-party computation and the Virtual People Framework (VPF). VPF uses advanced models for synthetic data for audience matching and projection to deliver insights without compromising privacy standards. Samba TV’s first-party dataset spans TV, digital, and streaming channels, enabling brands and agencies to measure performance based on real-world business outcomes with timeliness and speed to drive unparalleled media efficiency. About Samba TV Samba TV is a global leader in AI-driven media intelligence powered by first-party data from millions of opted-in connected televisions and billions of web signals across more than 50 countries. Its independent, cross-platform measurement provides advertisers and media companies with a unified view of the entire consumer journey. Leveraging real-time insights and audience optimization, Samba TV enables marketers to reach and engage audiences with efficiency and effectiveness across any platform and every screen.

Trinity Cyber Welcomes Shawn Turskey to Advisory Board as Company Accelerates Remarkable Growth PR Newswire Tue, October 21, 2025 at 8:05 AM EDT 4 min read In this article: META SNAP WASHINGTON , Oct. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Trinity Cyber, Inc., the preemptive cybersecurity pioneer, today announced that Shawn Turskey, a distinguished cybersecurity leader, has joined its Advisory Board. This appointment comes as Trinity Cyber rapidly scales to meet demand for its active cyber defense solution, solidifying its position as a category-defining company in the $200+ billion global cybersecurity market. Trinity Cyber New Logo Turskey most recently held senior leadership and technical roles at Meta and Snap and previously led security operations for the U.S. Intelligence Community and U.S. Cyber Command. Shawn brings decades of experience running global cyber operations and countering advanced threats. His expertise will help Trinity Cyber accelerate adoption across Fortune 500 enterprises and large government networks and guide the company through its international expansion. \"Investors and enterprise leaders alike recognize that the old cybersecurity model is broken,\" said Steve Ryan, Founder and CEO of Trinity Cyber. \"We refuse to accept the status quo. We built something entirely different, redefining what the market should expect in security and zero trust cloud access. Shawn's addition to our team underscores our momentum and signals confidence in our ability to deliver enterprise-scale preemptive protection no other solution can match.\" Unlike traditional detective controls that identify known threats and alert customers to respond, Trinity Cyber FCI technology sits between the customer and the hacker to interrupt attacks before they enter a network or as they communicate out—intercepting and neutralizing previously undiscoverable malicious activity and hacker techniques without interrupting business operations. The process is transparent to end users, slashes the growing costs of incident response, and saves wasted time chasing false positives. Integrated into switches and deployed at rack-scale at Internet peering points, the platform is purpose-built to scale with centralized operations directed at root cause hacker techniques. It reduces operational costs and dramatically improves security outcomes. Currently protecting over 3 million users and over 200 million network assets, the company is expanding its position as the leader in preemptive security, a market category that Gartner projects will account for 50% of IT security spending by 2030. \"Trinity Cyber is at the forefront of a seismic shift in the cybersecurity market,\" said Turskey. \"When I first learned about Trinity Cyber's capabilities, I was skeptical that such a technical breakthrough was even possible. This is not an incremental improvement—it's a disruptive technology that creates a new standard of protection. I'm excited to join at a moment when the company is not only changing the way enterprises defend themselves and how AI is trained, but also creating significant value for its investors.\" Story Continues Mike Sikorski, CTO of Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 and a fellow member of the Trinity Cyber Advisory Board, added: \"Trinity Cyber has a special technology that disrupts the attacker in line and at scale. This capability has solved one of the hardest problems in our industry. Disrupting the adversary as they are conducting an attack is critical to stop it immediately rather than chasing alerts. And messing with the bad guy is just plain fun! The company's preemptive technology is ahead of the market, and the impact for enterprises is enormous. Having Shawn join the Advisory Board strengthens the company's trajectory as a category creator.\" With recent sales momentum, Trinity Cyber is positioned to accelerate growth and broaden market penetration. \"We've created the most effective threat detection and prevention engine ever developed, and we have deployed it as infrastructure available to all,\" said Thomas P. Bossert, President of Trinity Cyber. \"Not a gadget. Not a software update. Security infrastructure; at rack scale in the Internet's switch fabric. Complete with power, space, cooling, and networking. It detects more accurately, and it strips malicious content from live network traffic. This is the same model that Nvidia used to power the AI revolution. Nvidia doesn't just sell GPU chips; it built them into AI infrastructure to lead the world's most important technology shift. Trinity Cyber is doing the same for cybersecurity, making it available and affordable for all. And it works. It delivers outcomes, not alerts.\" About Trinity Cyber, Inc. Trinity Cyber has redefined network security with advanced FCI technology built into the fabric of the Internet. The solution allows customers to improve security and reduce operating expenses, and it allows Trinity Cyber to amass a repository of content rich threat intelligence and scale operations with a system that spreads the benefits of its technology and its highly advanced engineers and operators to the collective benefit of all its customers. Unlike legacy tools that only detect known threats and feed a costly response cycle, the Trinity Cyber FCI platform intercepts and neutralizes malicious activity in its path, protecting enterprise users, edge infrastructure, and applications at scale. Driven by a team of innovators, security experts, and technology veterans, Trinity Cyber is headquartered in Bowie, Maryland. Discover the profound difference at www.trinitycyber.com .

Simply Wall St Tue, October 21, 2025 at 3:12 AM EDT 3 min read In this article: NVDA 2454.TW META ORCL NVIDIA has begun shipping the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer developed in partnership with MediaTek, enabling developers to locally prototype and fine-tune large AI models using the ultra-efficient GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This advancement, along with new client integrations like Meta and Oracle standardizing NVIDIA networking technologies, dramatically expands access to scalable, high-performance AI development beyond traditional cloud or data center environments.

These 33 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery . The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early. NVIDIA Investment Narrative Recap To be an NVIDIA shareholder today, you need to believe in the continued global surge in AI infrastructure spending and NVIDIA’s ability to maintain technology leadership and premium margins, despite mounting competition and geopolitical risks. The recent launch of the DGX Spark desktop AI supercomputer is an impressive technological step, but it does not appear to materially shift the near-term catalysts or risks, particularly ongoing US-China trade tension and customer vertical integration, both of which remain key uncertainties to watch. Among recent announcements, Oracle’s launch of the OCI Zettascale10, powered by NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure, stands out as highly relevant. This underlines the importance of partnerships in sustaining AI demand and scale, tying directly to near-term revenue catalysts, even as NVIDIA’s market share faces structural pressures from hyperscaler customers developing their own custom silicon.

By David Marino-Nachison Full Bio Before joining Investopedia, David Marino-Nachison was an editor at The Wall Street Journal focused mainly on daily markets and investing news. He also worked on The Journal’s publishing desk; as a writer and editor covering stocks at Barron’s; as an editor of features at MarketWatch; and on product development efforts at The Journal. Learn about our editorial policies Published October 20, 2025 01:01 PM EDT Shares of Google parent Alphabet have outperformed the S&P 500 and the Magnificent 7 this year. Greg Baker / AFP via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Analysts at Oppenheimer updated their targets on shares of Alphabet and Meta this weekend, saying they prefer the former to the latter. They cited what they saw as a friendlier valuation on Alphabet's shares, as well as more conservative Street estimates. You don't necessarily have to choose between the stocks of two Big Tech giants—but if you must, Oppenheimer has a pick for you. Shares of both Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Meta Platforms ( META ), owner of Facebook and Instagram, have been strong performers this year, outpacing the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF ( MAGS ) and the S&P 500. Still, Oppenheimer's analysts prefer the former's shares to the latter's. On Sunday, they put a $300 price tag on Alphabet, about 18% above Friday's close and the highest on Wall Street, and an $825 target on Meta, 15% higher than last week's finish and below Visible Alpha's analyst average. The Oppenheimer analysts cited what they considered \"more conservative\" Street estimates on Alphabet, along with a lower valuation on the shares. Why This Matters to Investors While the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks has outpaced the S&P 500 this year, under the hood there are signs that it might make sense to pick and choose carefully among them. One example: Three of the stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 this year. \"While we are positive on the long-term benefits from Meta's push into AI and proven ability to outgrow peers,\" they wrote, \"we are more bullish on [Alphabet] near term, given more conservative estimates and lower valuation.\" While the Magnificent 7 is running ahead of the S&P 500 this year, it's not surprising that investors might be looking to pick and choose among the group these days: Three of the seven stocks have underperformed the benchmark index year-to-date. More stocks outside the group are lifting the index than in recent years, Capital Group wrote last week, a reference to what's known as market breadth , marking \"a healthy move away from the extreme concentration that raised concerns about risks to investor portfolios.\" \"Rising valuations among companies in the index and more clarity on tariffs and interest rate cuts could help lift the U.S. equities market, which has trailed those in Europe and elsewhere,\" Capital Group wrote.

Aparajita Dutta Mon, October 20, 2025 at 9:38 AM EDT 4 min read In this article: SHOC SOXX SMH SOXQ TSM The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is proving to be a powerful and enduring force, driving a massive rally in semiconductor stocks and subsequently the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track them. Despite concerns of a potential bubble burst, continued expansion in AI is keeping the prospects for semiconductor ETFs bright. The Unstoppable AI Business Boom The AI sector has been experiencing unprecedented growth lately, fueled by historic levels of investment. As per Gartner’s September 2025 report, global spending on AI is expected to reach nearly $1.5 trillion by the end of this year. It is needless to mention that gigantic investments from major tech hyperscalers’ growing venture in data centers have been playing the role of a major growth catalyst for the AI business' boom. Evidently, Big Tech firms Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Meta ( META ) reported in August 2025 that they were set to spend as much as a cumulative $364 billion in their respective 2025 fiscal years, driven by their investments in AI, up from their prior estimates of around $325 billion (as cited in a Yahoo Finance press release). With AI being rapidly integrated across diverse industries, ranging from automation of manual tasks in banking to personalizing treatment in the healthcare service industry, its growth prospects remain robust. Gartner projects overall global AI spending to exceed $2 trillion by 2026-end. Why Semiconductors Are Soaring Semiconductor companies remain the fundamental building blocks of AI. Advanced chips are essential for processing the enormous, data-intensive workloads required for AI applications. This has led to enormous growth for the semiconductor industry. Notably, the Morningstar Global Semiconductors Index surged 34% (from the start of the year till Sept. 29, 2025), registering more than double the return of the entire U.S. market. Interestingly, the AI boom is benefiting not just chip designers like NVIDIA ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) but also manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ) and equipment suppliers like ASML Holding ( ASML ), which are critical to producing advanced semiconductors. Looking ahead, Morningstar analysts expect AI chip revenues to increase roughly fourfold over the next few years, growing at a compound annual rate of 40% through 2028. This indicates the solid growth potential for semiconductor stocks. The Case for Semiconductor ETFs While the AI boom is here to stay, it goes without saying that uncertainty continues to persist in multiple forms, like the U.S.-China trade tension or an unexpected geopolitical event, potentially impacting one or more of the semiconductor stocks mentioned above. So, ETFs tracking these stocks will offer a strategic way to capitalize on the AI growth trend while managing risk. Story Continues As most of the semiconductor ETFs provide concentrated exposure to the entire semiconductor ecosystem, from designers and manufacturers to equipment suppliers, investing in them will instantly diversify your portfolio, mitigating the risk of investing in individual stocks. Semiconductor ETFs in Focus To make the most of the current market situation, investors interested in semiconductor ETFs may keep these ETFs in their portfolios: VanEck Semiconductor ETF ( SMH ) This fund, with total net assets worth $33.81 billion, offers exposure to companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment. Its top three holdings are NVIDIA (18.03%), Taiwan Semiconductor (9.89%) and Broadcom (8.25%). SMH has rallied 41.6% year to date. The fund charges 35 basis points (bps) as fees.

Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya lifted his price target for Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD , Financials ) to $300 from $250, maintaining a Buy rating after the company's announcements at the 2025 Open Compute Project Global Summit. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with AMD. Is AMD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Arya said AMD's new MI450 Helios rack-scale AI platform gives the chipmaker greater visibility into deployment and production timelines across key enterprise clients, strengthening its position in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence training markets currently led by Nvidia. The Helios platform, expected to launch in the second half of 2026, is backed by major industry customers including Oracle, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI. Arya projects AMD could secure up to 50% of OpenAI's planned 6-gigawatt GPU rollout over four years, generating an estimated $1.4 billion in 2026 and $9.7 billion in 2027. The analyst forecasts potential earnings per share between $10 and $11 by 2027 if the full contract materializes. He added that AMD's technology now underpins multiple open-standard AI networking ecosystems, supporting interoperability across CPUs, accelerators, and network components. Arya also noted that AMD continues to gain share in both PC and server CPU markets against Intel, whose manufacturing delays have limited competitiveness versus AMD and ARM-based designs built on TSMC's latest nodes. According to TipRanks data, AMD holds a Strong Buy consensus based on 29 Buy and 10 Hold ratings. The average price target of $249.92 implies about 7% upside from recent levels. AMD shares have risen roughly 93% year-to-date. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Mail Link October 20, 2025 Photo by István Szitás via Unsplash Sign up for smart news, insights, and analysis on the biggest financial stories of the day. Subscribe Brian Boyle brian@thedailyupside.com October 20, 2025 AI is a bubble. That’s not our opinion. That’s the opinion of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has been saying so since at least August . And the opinion of Jeff Bezos, who said AI is in an “industrial bubble” earlier this month . And it’s the opinion of 54% of the respondents in Bank of America’s October Global Fund Manager Survey, released last week , who cite an AI bubble as the biggest tail risk facing the global economy today. The move from “denial” to “casual acceptance” comes just as the AI-powered bull market officially turns three years old, as of Monday last week (perhaps not-so-coincidentally, ChatGPT turns three next month). In other words, we may just be living in the most talked-about bubble in financial history. So why is everyone singing “Happy Birthday” to the largely AI-fueled bull run with such a happy face? Chips Don’t Lie There are about 800 billion reasons some see the AI market as a bubble. That’s the amount in dollars, roughly, that global corporations have put toward AI-related capital expenditures in 2023, 2024 and 2025 combined (and conservative forecasts see AI capex reaching $1 trillion per year by 2030). That titanic level of spending has been the primary driver of US GDP growth this year, according to Harvard economists , as well as the vast majority of gains on the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley analysts . In nominal dollars, it’s the biggest capex boom in history. Venture capitalist Paul Kedrosky recently noted that, as a percentage of GDP, the AI infrastructure buildout is about on par with the telecom infrastructure buildout of the 1990s and could even approach the roughly 6% of GDP that the investment in railroads hit in the 1880s. The railroad buildout led to multiple bubbles and collapses of its own (most prominently, the Panic of 1893 ). The telecom buildout preceded the dot-com bubble. But both also led to an enduring industry that generated enormous amounts of wealth. That provides some context as to why tech leaders seem to be shrugging off the bubble talk, and perhaps some clues as to why they shouldn’t be: The vast majority of AI-related capex has gone toward building massive data centers for expensive AI-powering GPU servers, according to a recent McKinsey report . But unlike relatively long-lasting railway and internet infrastructure, the average data center GPU may have a lifespan as short as one to three years . It’s why AI capex isn’t slowing down anytime soon. It’s also why a Bain Capital report published last month argued that AI companies will need to generate $2 trillion in annual revenue by 2030 to be profitable; as The Wall Street Journal recently noted, that’s more than the combined 2024 revenue of Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, and five times more than the global subscription software market. The WheAIt from the ChAIff: Most estimates leave the industry at least $1 trillion short of that mark. According to a Citigroup note earlier this year, AI revenue is expected to reach $43 billion in 2025 and grow to $780 billion by 2030. The AI version of Pets.com won’t make it that long.

      "text": "3 Best Tech Stocks to Buy in October By Geoffrey Seiler – Oct 20, 2025 at 4:50AM Key Points Nvidia has seen explosive growth, which shows no signs of relenting. AI is helping fuel growth throughout Microsoft's businesses. Meta Platforms' site has become a premier destination for advertisers, while the company is also making some intriguing longer-term bets. NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Market Cap $4.5T Today's Change angle-down ( 2.26 %) $ 4.13 Current Price $ 186.28 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:59 PM ET These three tech leaders have strong momentum heading into earnings season. Technology stocks continue to lead the market higher, and there are no significant signs of that slowing down. Let's look at three top tech stocks to buy this month that have momentum going into earnings season. Nvidia Nvidia ( NVDA +2.26% ) has been one of the most explosive growth stories of the past five years. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) help power nearly every major artificial intelligence (AI) project, while its CUDA software platform has created a wide moat for the company. That led to an astonishing 94% market share in the GPU space last quarter. Image source: Getty Images. The company's results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Its data center revenue has surged from just over $10 billion two years ago to more than $40 billion last quarter, with demand showing no signs of slowing. This growth isn't only coming from chips, either, as its data center networking business revenue nearly doubled to $7.5 billion in the quarter. Now, Nvidia is going even deeper into the AI ecosystem, with its (up to) $100 billion investment in OpenAI helping to both strengthen a key partnership and ensure that a major customer has the capital to keep buying its chips. With OpenAI and other hyperscalers (companies that own massive data centers) continuing to spend big on AI infrastructure, Nvidia looks well-positioned for both Q3 and beyond. Expand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( 2.26 %) $ 4.13 Current Price $ 186.28 Key Data Points Market Cap $4526B Day's Range $ 183.51 - $ 187.47 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 195.62 Volume 5.1M Avg Vol 173M Gross Margin 69.85 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Microsoft Microsoft ( MSFT +0.56% ) has spent decades reinventing itself, and it's done it again with AI. Its cloud computing platform, Azure, has become one of the biggest AI beneficiaries, growing its revenue nearly 40% last quarter, tops among the three big cloud providers. Microsoft's big advantage stems from its early investment and partnership with OpenAI, which gave it privileged access to its cutting-edge foundational large language models (LLMs) . As companies rush to deploy their own AI models and apps, Azure is a top choice due to its access to OpenAI's models. Expand NASDAQ : MSFT Microsoft Today's Change ( 0.56 %) $ 2.93 Current Price $ 523.49 Key Data Points Market Cap $3892B Day's Range $ 520.76 - $ 525.35 52wk Range $ 344.79 - $ 555.45 Volume 681K Avg Vol 20M Gross Margin 68.82 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % Meanwhile, AI is helping drive growth throughout its business. Last quarter, the company was clicking on all cylinders, with its overall revenue climbing 18% to more than $76 billion. Enterprises are starting to embrace its AI Copilot assistants, which helped power a 16% increase in its Productivity and Business Processes segment. But what stands out about Microsoft is how balanced its growth has become. Cloud, productivity, gaming, and advertising are all performing well. Microsoft just turned in one of its best quarters in a long time to end its fiscal year, and its momentum should continue into fiscal 2026. That makes Microsoft a solid stock to buy this month. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms ( META +0.64% ) is another company that has undergone an impressive transformation over the past few years. After investors had basically written off its social media platforms as obsolete, the company has been able to shift its platform's focus more toward entertainment and use AI to overhaul its recommendation algorithms to keep users on Facebook and Instagram longer. This, in turn, has led to more ad inventory to sell. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.17 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 662K Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % At the same time, Meta introduced new AI tools to help advertisers create better ad campaigns and to improve targeting. With its advertising getting better results, Meta's ad prices have also climbed. High ad inventory and prices helped fuel a 22% jump in revenue for the company last quarter. That momentum should continue into earnings season, as Facebook and Instagram have become two of the most attractive platforms for advertisers. Long-term, Meta has a big opportunity with some of its new platforms. It's just beginning to serve ads on WhatsApp and Threads, which should drive growth in the coming years. Meanwhile, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is investing tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and research, betting that \"personal superintelligence\" will eventually become a major consumer technology. The company has also introduced AI-driven hardware like smart glasses and is still investing heavily in the metaverse . Between its near-term momentum and long-term opportunities, Meta is a stock to buy.

Meta Platforms should deliver excellent shareholder returns, driven by its AI initiatives and robust advertising business. NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Market Cap $1.5T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.46 %) $ 4.23 Current Price $ 294.96 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET These leading companies are no-brainer buys right now. Artificial intelligence (AI) could create substantial gains for investors in the next decade. The best thing about this opportunity is that you don't need to chase high-risk stocks to do well. The AI revolution is being driven by the most dominant companies in technology. Here are two top AI stocks trading at reasonable valuations to add to your investment portfolio this month. Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. 1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing The leading chip manufacturer is a no-brainer stock to consider buying right now. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM +1.46% ) are up 50% year to date, continuing the company's long history of delivering market-beating returns for shareholders. TSMC is in a very profitable position of making chips for the leading chip designers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It makes the investment in advanced chipmaking equipment so that these companies can execute their strategy of designing the best chips in the world. Expand NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today's Change ( 1.46 %) $ 4.23 Current Price $ 294.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $1530B Day's Range $ 294.39 - $ 297.95 52wk Range $ 134.25 - $ 311.37 Volume 8.7M Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 58.06 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % Management expects to deliver 20% compound annual growth in revenue through 2029. TSMC supplies chips for just about everything: consumer electronics, smartphones, and high-performance computing. But AI is where the company is seeing the greatest velocity in demand. The company's outlook calls for over 40% annualized revenue growth, specifically from AI chips, over the next several years. During the company's second-quarter earnings call with analysts, CEO C.C. Wei noted the growing demand for AI models influencing its long-term forecast: \"The explosive growth in token volume demonstrates increasing AI model usage and adoption, which means more and more computation is needed, leading to more leading-edge silicon demand.\" Given the company's favorable outlook, the stock appears to offer solid value even after the strong run this year. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple around 24 using 2026 earnings estimates, which should support excellent shareholder returns over the next five years. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms ( META +0.64% ) emerged as a major player in the AI arms race. It invested heavily in AI infrastructure to support growth in its products and services, including its social media apps, AI-driven ad technology, and AI-powered smart glasses in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The fundamental advantage for Meta is that it has half the planet using its social media services like Facebook and Instagram. This translates to robust advertising revenue and profits that it can reinvest in data centers and chips for an AI-driven future. Analysts expect Meta's revenue to be up 19% this year to reach $196 billion, with earnings per share expected to grow 18% to $28.19, according to Yahoo! Finance. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.17 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 662K Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Management continues to plow its money into more infrastructure. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be as high as $72 billion to support AI initiatives and business operations. The investments in its ad technology are paying off with more relevant ads that are driving solid growth in advertising revenue. A key priority of CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2026 is growing the company's head count for AI development. This is to accelerate the build-out of Meta Superintelligence Labs that will guide its efforts on AI models and product initiatives. During Meta's Q2 earnings call, CFO Susan Li suggested that these investments could even expand Meta's addressable market to new services or products over time: \"We expect the significant investments we're making now will allow us to continue leveraging advances in AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the years to come.\" This is a financial powerhouse of a business that is using AI to grow the value of the business for shareholders. Zuckerberg appears determined to make Meta a leading AI company, and the stock's valuation does not fully account for this potential. Using Wall Street's 2026 earnings estimates, investors can buy the stock at a reasonable forward P/E of 24.

E.l.f.'s acquisition of Rhode should drive its next leg of growth. A recent dip in the price of Toast's stock gives investors a nice opportunity to buy this fast-growing stock at a discount. NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Market Cap $1.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Growth stocks continue to lead the market higher. Growth stocks have been getting most of the market's attention for more than a decade now, and signs point to that continuing well into the future. And while technology growth stocks get most of the press, there are growth stocks to be found across multiple sectors. Here, I'll take a look at three solid growth stocks to buy now and hold for the long term. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms ( META +0.64% ) is not the same company it was several years ago, as it has used artificial intelligence (AI) to reinvigorate growth. While Facebook and Instagram were originally created as social media sites where users could easily connect with friends and family, today the sites are much more about consuming outside entertainment. Meta has recognized this and is now using AI to improve its content recommendation algorithm to feed users more of the content they want to see. This is keeping users more engaged and spending more time on its platforms, which leads to more ad inventory. Image source: Getty Images. At the same time, the company has built AI tools to let advertisers create more captivating campaigns and better target users. That is leading to strong ad demand and higher pricing. This all could be seen in the second quarter as its ad impression climbed 11%, while average price per ad jumped 9%. Meta is also sitting on massive under-monetized assets. WhatsApp has roughly 3 billion users, yet the company is just starting to introduce ads there. Threads, its new text-based platform, is growing its user base fast, giving Meta another platform to expand its ad reach. Each of these can add incremental billions in revenue once scaled. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.17 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 662K Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Meta is also looking to move beyond social media. The company is spending heavily on AI infrastructure and talent because it wants to power what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls \"personal superintelligence.\" That is a big, long-term swing, but the company has the balance sheet and free cash flow to take it, and it adds nice long-term optionality to an already solid growth story. e.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty ( ELF 1.77% ) has been one of the best growth stories in consumer goods, as it has taken huge share in the mass cosmetics space over the past several years. However, its recent acquisition of Rhode is the big story now. Rhode, founded by celebrity Hailey Bieber, was built selling just a handful of skincare products online with little paid marketing. Despite that, it managed to cross $200 million in sales in under three years. That's impressive, and it shows the power of the brand that Bieber created. Expand NYSE : ELF e.l.f. Beauty Today's Change ( -1.77 %) $ -2.21 Current Price $ 122.81 Key Data Points Market Cap $7B Day's Range $ 122.53 - $ 127.75 52wk Range $ 49.40 - $ 150.99 Volume 1M Avg Vol 1.9M Gross Margin 67.23 % Dividend Yield N/A E.l.f. now has the opportunity to take Rhode to the next level, as it has the manufacturing and retail relationships to bring Rhode to store shelves around the globe. The brand launched at Sephora in the U.S. and Canada this fall and immediately became one of the retailer's top-selling lines, capturing roughly a third of Sephora's total sales on its first day. E.l.f. can now do what it does best: Drive distribution and expand assortment. Rhode only offers a small number of SKUs, so e.l.f. can help it broaden its product lineup. It will also likely look to push it into other stores in the coming years. It has strong relationships with Ulta Beauty and Target , so they are potential future distribution outlets. Rhode also comes with higher price points and stronger gross margins , which will help lift profitability across its business. One of the best times to buy a consumer goods company is when it's about to gain distribution and shelf space, and e.l.f is very much in the early innings of doing just this with Rhode. Toast Toast ( TOST 1.21% ) has become an essential partner for restaurants, and its growth story is still in the early innings. The company's platform runs nearly every core function for restaurants, from staffing and payroll to marketing, menu design, and payment processing. The more modules a restaurant adopts, the more dependent it becomes on Toast's system, which drives higher revenue per location and very sticky retention. Toast also earns a small cut of every transaction that runs through its system, tying its growth directly to its customers' success. The company has been seeing strong growth. Last quarter, it added a record 8,500 net new locations, bringing the total to about 148,000, up 24% from a year ago. Subscription revenue climbed 37%, and its annual recurring revenue (which, for it, is its annualized subscription revenue plus the gross profits of its payment processing business) jumped 31% to $1.9 billion. Expand NYSE : TOST Toast Today's Change ( -1.21 %) $ -0.47 Current Price $ 38.33 Key Data Points Market Cap $22B Day's Range $ 38.30 - $ 39.69 52wk Range $ 28.12 - $ 49.66 Volume 161K Avg Vol 8.3M Gross Margin 25.14 % Dividend Yield N/A What's exciting is how much white space still exists. There are more than 700,000 restaurants in the U.S., and many still use outdated legacy systems. Toast is also now pushing into coffee shops, bakeries, hotels, and even grocery stores, with each a new vertical expanding its addressable market. It's also beginning to expand internationally, with operations in Australia, the U.K., Ireland, and Canada. The stock recently sank after an accidental price decrease showed up on its website, but that was quickly addressed, and prices were restored to prior levels. That dip gives investors a nice opportunity to buy this fast-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS ) company at a discount.

Pool / ABACA / Shutterstock.com Andrew Lisa Sun, October 19, 2025 at 11:10 PM EDT 2 min read In this article: META According to Forbes , Mark Zuckerberg is more than $200 billion poorer than Elon Musk . However, his $266.6 billion fortune is still big enough to make him the second-richest person in the world. The Facebook founder and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have publicly pledged to give away 99% of their Meta holdings as they work to end, cure or manage all diseases by 2100.

Find Out: 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won't Regret Buying in 2025 But how big is Zuckerberg’s stake in Meta, and what if, instead of ending sickness, he chose to give an equal share of his company stock to every person in America as his philanthropic mission? A 13% Share of a Nearly $2 Trillion Company Meta has a market capitalization (market cap) of $1.96 trillion, making it one of just 11 companies in the world worth 13 figures. Market cap is a metric that measures a publicly traded company’s value by multiplying its stock price by the number of outstanding shares. As of Sept. 21, Meta trades at roughly $778 per share, and Forbes estimates that Zuckerberg owns approximately 13% of the company’s stock. That makes his share worth $255 billion, accounting for all but a measly $11.6 billion of Zuckerberg’s fabulous fortune.

If Zuckerberg were to divvy up his 13% share of Meta among all of them equally, everyone in America would get $749.76. It Depends on Which Day He Starts Feeling Generous This number changes by the minute, though. Remember, market cap is a company’s stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares, and share prices fluctuate all day, every day. On April 21, for example, Facebook was trading at $487 — 37.4% less than its price on September 21. On that day, Zuckerberg’s 13% was worth just $159.63 billion, which would have left every American a dramatically reduced — but still free — $469.35 each.

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week . On October 17, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” and raised its price target to $300 per share from $250. “We rate AMD Buy. It serves a multi-hundred billion addressable market opportunity in PC, server, high-end gaming, deep-learning and related markets where AMD has less than 30% value share currently.” The firm also discussed how it sees improved visibility into AMD’s MI450 Series ‘Helios’ racks launching in 2H26, supported by customers such as Oracle, Meta, and OpenAI. Further, the analysts have marked 11/11 as the next date to watch out for, deeming it the next major catalyst. “Overall, we now see greater visibility into the deployment and ramp outlook of MI450 Series ‘Helios’ racks launching in 2H26, supported by key industry customers such as Oracle, Meta, and OpenAI (more details on pg. 3).\" \"As a result, we now assume 50% OpenAI deal (6 GW deployment over 4 years) fall-through in our base model, raise sales/EPS ests, and highlight upside toward $10–11 EPS power by CY27E at 100% fall-through. Our new $300 PO is based on unch. 33x CY27E PE, still within 14x–55x historical range. Next major catalyst includes upcoming Analyst Day in NYC on 11/11. Separately, we also highlight very low AMD ownership amongst active fund managers at just ~20% of funds as of August, as well as just 0.16x weighting within SPX at funds, down significantly YoY vs. market-weight+ (1.00x+) for most large cap semis peers.” Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "text": "Nvidia's Big Tech customers might also be its biggest competitive threat Laura Bratton Updated Mon, October 20, 2025 at 1:52 AM EDT 6 min read In this article: GOOG AMZN META OPAI.PVT NVDA Nvidia's ( NVDA ) own Big Tech customers are poised to capture a sizable slice of the AI chip market — a dynamic that could eventually dig into the chipmaker's profit margins. Tech giants have been making moves to bolster their in-house chipmaking businesses. ChatGPT developer OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) — a big customer of Nvidia's chips by way of renting cloud space in Microsoft's ( MSFT ) and CoreWeave's ( CRWV ) data centers — said it will begin designing its own custom chips in partnership with Broadcom . Meta ( META ) announced a plan in late September to acquire chip startup Rivos as it bolsters its own in-house chip efforts. Amazon ( AMZN ) said this summer that its massive data center project called Project Rainier, in which hundreds of thousands of its Trainium2 chips that will be used by AI developer Anthropic, is \"well underway,\" and analysts have said demand for its chips that have already been deployed in data centers from Anthropic has significantly risen. While the lion's share of the AI chip market is dominated by Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units), tech companies led by Alphabet-owned Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon, and Microsoft design custom chips in partnership with chipmakers Broadcom and Marvell Technology ( MRVL ). The chips are cheaper and better optimized for those companies' software, analysts explained. While these Big Tech cloud providers don't sell physical, standalone chips to other companies like Nvidia does, the firms internally run their AI models off their own chips, and their cloud customers also have the option to run AI workloads using those custom chips at a lower cost. JPMorgan said in a research note in June that custom chips designed by companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI will account for 45% of the AI chip market by 2028, up from 37% in 2024 and 40% in 2025. The rest of the chip market is held by producers of GPUs, namely Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). 'Death by a thousand cuts' The \"Magnificent Seven\" names have a good reason to design their own chips. \"In the case of all the hyperscalers looking at custom silicon, the strategic angle here is they don't want to be stuck behind an NVIDIA monopoly,\" Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg said. The incredibly high cost of Nvidia's AI chips has meant cloud providers make lower profits renting out those chips than they could renting their own, analysts said. \"Nvidia now has to compete with its customers,\" Goldberg added. While tech firms' custom chips are broadly used to run internal AI workloads, Google reportedly began physically selling its AI chips called TPUs (tensor processing units) to a cloud provider in September — a move that would see it directly compete with the likes of Nvidia. DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria estimated Google's TPU business, combined with its DeepMind AI segment, to be worth $900 billion and said it is \"arguably one of Alphabet's most valuable businesses.\" Story Continues \"Google's TPUs remain the best alternative to NVIDIA, with the gap between the two closing significantly over the past 9-12 months,\" Luria wrote in a note to clients in September. \"[S]hould Google sell its systems externally to customers, demand would be there and specifically from notable frontier AI labs.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai unveils Google's sixth-generation Trillium TPU at a Google I/O event in 2024. Google released its seventh generation TPU, Ironwood, in 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Overall, Seaport's Goldberg said he expects \"a lot of activity around custom silicon\" in 2026 based on his conversations throughout the AI chip supply chain. Big Tech companies are at different stages in the evolution of their chip businesses. Google has been developing its AI chips called TPUs for more than a decade and is a clear leader among its peers, analysts told Yahoo Finance. Amazon started its in-house chip journey a year after Google launched its first TPU through the acquisition of chip startup Anapurna Labs in 2015 and released its first Trainium chip in 2020 . Meanwhile, Microsoft launched its first custom Maia AI chip in 2023 and has fallen behind its peers. While the custom chips may be cheaper to use, AI developers often prefer Nvidia's chips because of the software stack that goes with them. Though Nvidia is a clear leader today, Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson said the tech giants' custom chip efforts will eventually dig into Nvidia's profits: \"Over time, the margins that Nvidia can command right now get degraded ... [it will be] sort of death by a thousand cuts because you have all of these different custom silicon accelerators [chips] that exist because there's such an opportunity.\" When asked about the competitive threat of custom chips in a recent podcast appearance , Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to dismiss the concern, saying Nvidia is more than just an AI chipmaker, as it provides full-scale server systems, not just individual GPUs. Whereas its customers are, in many cases, building single chips, Nvidia designs massive server racks with multiple in-house chips from its Blackwell GPUs to its Arm-based central processing units (CPUs) and networking products , which allow the chips to talk to one another. \"We're the only company in the world today that builds all of the chips inside an AI infrastructure,\" Huang told the \"BG2\" podcast in September. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang at Computex 2025 at the Taipei Music Center in May 2025. (I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images) · I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images Some analysts also argue that the market for AI chips is so big that there's room for tech firms to expand their custom chip efforts without crowding the market for Nvidia. Bank of America's Vivek Arya and DA Davidson's Gil Luria both said verbatim in separate interviews that the growing market share of custom chips \"doesn't matter.\" That's because Nvidia has \"managed to consistently expand the size of the market,\" Arya explained. Nvidia has invested heavily in the AI ecosystem and \"neocloud\" companies that rival its own customers, with $47 billion worth of venture capital investments in AI companies from 2020 through September of this year, per Pitchbook data. \"The growth and demand is so substantial,\" Luria said. \"We're going to need a lot more compute and the [AI] models are getting more useful, which is to say the pie is gonna get a lot bigger over the next couple of years.\" \"Nvidia won't grow as fast as the market, but because the market is growing so fast, they'll still be able to grow,\" he added. Also diminishing the concern for Nvidia: Not all tech giants embarking on custom chip efforts will present an equal threat to Nvidia's dominance. \"The drawback of doing your own silicon, though, is that it's hard,\" Goldberg said. \"I think ultimately what will happen is not all of them will succeed.\" StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the trending stocks to watch. James Van Geelen, the founder and portfolio manager at Citrini Research, was asked during a podcast on Bloomberg why Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) had to sign a deal with CoreWeave when it has significant data center capacity. Here is what the analyst said “It’s basically, I would say anything you can do to shift that CapEx away from yourself Okay. A lot of this stuff is funded from Cashflow and yeah, we’re starting to see debt financing take its place. But if you arerunning a company that’s existed for a while and is one of the biggest companies in the world, and yes, you could justify taking anor inordinate amount, amounts of risk to do this. But just like anyone else, if you have a goal and you can kind of shift away some of that risk to, ’cause if, you know, if Core weve goes bankrupt Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) not, it’s not, it’s not the worst thing in the world for Meta.” CoreWeave recently signed a $14 billion agreement with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) to supply the Zuckerberg-led giant with computing power capacity. Analyst Explains Why Meta Platforms (META) Signed Data Center Deal With Coreweave Photo by Campaign Creators on Unsplash With daily active users of about 3.48 billion, Meta’s huge edge in the AI race is the data and user base it has access to, which is extremely useful for ads targeting and monetization. In 2024, digital advertising accounted for about 98% of the company’s total revenue. The business is thriving for now. In the June quarter, price per ad rose 9% year over year, reflecting higher returns for advertisers and a favorable supply and demand balance for Meta. However, an overall slowdown in digital advertising and huge spending from the company could limit the stock’s upside. Between 2014 and 2019, digital advertising rose about 20% annually, but growth is now expected to slow to 9% per year from 2025 through 2030. Meta is expected to spend about $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 on capital expenditures to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Unlike hardware chip makers like Nvidia, which make money by selling AI chips, companies like Meta would need to show actual results from their AI spending to unlock more shareholder value in the short term. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world’s largest social-media company, spanning Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, and its Reality Labs arm pursues next-generation augmented- and virtual-reality hardware. Its Family of Apps averaged 3.4 billion daily active users in March 2025, highlighting the unrivalled scale that underpins its advertising franchise. The company’s AI powered ad-delivery tools are driving higher pricing and better campaign performance, while new initiatives—such as the rollout of ads in WhatsApp—have the potential to unlock fresh revenue streams and are supported by a cash-rich balance-sheet that now includes a quarterly dividend. Shares rose during the quarter after fiscal first-quarter results came in better-than-expected due to strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Additionally, management guided fiscal second-quarter revenue above consensus and trimmed full-year expense guidance even as it lifted capital-expenditure plans to accelerate AI-infrastructure build-out.” Story Continues While we acknowledge the potential of METtA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "text": "The Biggest Meta Settlements Of All Time By Larissa Zageris Oct. 19, 2025 8:00 am EST Mijansk786/Shutterstock Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms or simply Meta, is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world. Meta's $1.8 trillion dollar market cap keeps it nipping at the heels of companies as massively valuable as Amazon, Google's Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft, as well as companies making major money movies like Nvidia . Meta has faced serious big-ticket lawsuits over the years, and has made some massive settlements for its alleged crimes. The big tech giant's platforms have grown to contain a user base of more than 3 billion people, and it controls Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta has paid (or will pay) for its involvement in a variety of crimes, including breaking digital competition laws, violating biometric privacy laws, and issues with collecting the data of children under 13. Meta has also come under fire for what some called censorship after removing President Donald Trump from some of its platforms. But you know what they say: Don't do the crime unless you can pay the fine. Meta has paid settlements to the tune of millions and billions of dollars since its first $5 billion government penalty fine in 2019. Meta could also owe billions more for violating private data on Flo, a fertility tracking app. While Meta hasn't necessarily admitted to any criminal wrongdoing, it is in the tremendously advantageous financial position to pay any of its misdeeds away. Even so, the public's awareness of any alleged wrongdoing isn't so easily paid away. Settlements in the millions Pool/Getty Images In 2025, Meta paid a settlement of $25 million to President Donald Trump. This came after the lawsuit Trump filed in 2021 in response to his suspension from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. Facebook cited that Trump had broken rules surrounding using the platforms to stoke violence. Trump claimed his First Amendment rights to free expression had been censored with the suspension. Though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was once critical of Trump, he has since become friendly with the president and Meta even donated $1 million to his second inaugural campaign. In 2020, Meta settled a class-action lawsuit for violating facial recognition privacy laws in Illinois. The lawsuit found that Meta used Facebook's facial recognition technology inappropriately, and stored facial biometric data without consent, therefore violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The settlement was for $650 million, and came after five years of hard legal fighting. Meta also began making its largest privacy class action settlement payments in 2025 for a 2022 lawsuit regarding Facebook illegally allowing third parties like Cambridge Analytica to view its user data. This is a $725 million dollar settlement, made in payments of around $34 or so to millions of members. If it seems stunning that a company can even survive after paying out like this, your jaw may hit the floor when you see some of the larger settlements it's paid. Settlements in the billions Pool/Getty Images In 2023, the Irish Data Protection Commission levied a $1.3 billion fine against Meta for unlawfully transferring European user data to the U.S. This massive fine came shortly after settlements paid by Meta to other Irish regulators for other data breaches and privacy violations. In 2022, Meta also agreed to pay around €405 million — roughly $425 million — for violating children's privacy protections in Ireland. Even so, its stock still went up in 2023 . That same year, the State of Texas sued Meta for using Facebook's facial recognition technology to essentially store and steal facial biometric data without consent. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton alleged the facial shape detail taken from uploaded photographs chalked up to \"tens of millions of violations\" in a 2022 tweet . Ultimately, the suit cost Meta $1.4 billion in settlement payments, which started to pay out over their five-year course in 2024. Even more recently, Meta's own shareholders won an $8 billion settlement after suing the company for the costs incurred by its repeated privacy violations. The settlement was reached in July 2025, cutting the case short before many parties expected to testify took the stand. Details about the settlement have not been discussed, and many key players on the defendant's side are keeping their mouths shut tighter than an Instagram profile on Private. Of course, Meta's not the only major tech company currently under fire: Amazon is also due to pay out a $2.5 billion settlement to eligible customers ."

      "text": "Is This AI Stock Still Worth Buying After Its Massive Rally? By Leo Sun – Oct 19, 2025 at 6:30AM Key Points Nvidia generated massive multibagger gains for its patient investors. It’s still selling the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush. Its stock looks reasonably valued relative to its long-term growth potential. NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Market Cap $4.5T Today's Change angle-down ( 2.26 %) $ 4.13 Current Price $ 186.28 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:59 PM ET Nvidia is the linchpin of the booming AI market, but it still has a lot of upside potential. Nvidia ( NVDA +2.26% ) is the bellwether of the booming artificial intelligence ( AI ) market. It's the leading producer of discrete GPUs for data centers, which are used to process complex AI tasks. Most of the world's top AI companies -- including OpenAI, Microsoft , and Meta Platforms -- use its chips to power their latest AI applications. Over the past five years, Nvidia's stock price has rallied about 1,230%. From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this January), its annual revenue surged at a CAGR of 64% from $10.9 billion to $130.5 billion, its adjusted gross margin expanded from 62.5% to 75.5%, and its adjusted net income grew at a CAGR of 83% from $3.6 billion to $74.3 billion. Those jaw-dropping growth rates turned Nvidia into the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $4.41 trillion. But should you still buy its stock after that massive rally? Let's review the bull and bear cases to find out. Why the bulls still love Nvidia The bulls will tell you that Nvidia still sells the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, and that feverish demand won't wane anytime soon. From 2025 to 2035, Grand View Research expects the global AI market to expand at a CAGR of 31.5% as more companies develop new AI products and services. Nvidia controls more than 90% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, and its AI GPUs are widely considered the \"best in breed\" chips for AI applications. It reinforces that dominance with its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming platform. When developers write their AI applications in a common parallel code (like C++ or Python) on CUDA, those programs become optimized for Nvidia's GPUs but can't run on its competitors' chips. Nvidia's top-tier Blackwell GPUs face some competition from AMD 's ( AMD +7.62% ) cheaper Instinct MI300X GPUs in the data center market. However, its Blackwell chips still outperform the MI300X in handling most large-scale AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. It also locks in its top customers -- including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet 's Google Cloud -- with sticky strategic partnerships to widen its moat against AMD and other potential competitors. From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share ( EPS ) to both grow at a CAGR of 36% as it continues to dominate the AI chip market. At $183, its stock still looks reasonably valued at 30 times next year's earnings. Expand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( 2.26 %) $ 4.13 Current Price $ 186.28 Key Data Points Market Cap $4526B Day's Range $ 183.51 - $ 187.47 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 195.62 Volume 5.1M Avg Vol 173M Gross Margin 69.85 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Why the bears are wary of Nvidia The bears will warn you about Nvidia's exposure to the messy tariffs and trade conflicts, AMD's new AI deals, and a potential slowdown of the broader AI market. U.S. regulators already blocked Nvidia from shipping its top-tier A800 and H800 data center GPUs to China in late 2023, and they expanded that ban to include its less powerful H20 variant chips this August. China's regulators then barred its own companies from buying Nvidia's chips in September. That ongoing conflict will significantly reduce Nvidia's sales to China, which accounted for roughly 17% and 13% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, respectively. Some of Nvidia's top customers, including Oracle and OpenAI, also recently struck new AI infrastructure deals with AMD. Those deals suggest that some AI companies are eager to curb their dependence on Nvidia, diversify their AI infrastructure with other types of chips, and reduce their long-term expenses with AMD's more cost-efficient chips. So, while AMD is still a distant underdog in the AI GPU market , it could chip away at Nvidia's dominance -- just as it did to Intel in the x86 CPU market over the past decade . Lastly, the AI market's breakneck growth could be throttled by tighter government restrictions -- especially with regard to its usage of copyrighted materials, its displacement of human workers, and privacy concerns. If those tighter restrictions coincide with a broader economic slowdown, big AI companies could dial back their aggressive GPU purchases. Which argument makes more sense? Over the next five years, I doubt Nvidia can replicate its multibagger gains from the previous five years. But it's still growing like a weed, it has plenty of irons in the fire, and it doesn't look overvalued relative to its growth potential. Investors should keep an eye on its competitive and regulatory threats, but I believe it's still worth buying at these levels.

      "text": "The Best Trillion-Dollar Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street By Adam Levy – Oct 19, 2025 at 4:50AM Key Points The trillion-dollar club is full of the leading technology companies, all getting a boost from artificial intelligence (AI). This company could supercharge its revenue growth with further advancements in generative AI. While there are some risks, the stock is priced attractively enough to account for that. NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Market Cap $1.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 0.59 %) $ 4.36 Current Price $ 738.36 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET This artificial intelligence (AI) giant could benefit in the near term and long term from technological advances. Just over seven years ago, Apple became the first trillion-dollar company. Since then, nine other publicly traded companies entered the $1 trillion club. The list is full of technology giants who have seen their fortunes soar amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. And while many of them still look appealing despite their massive market caps , one stands out as the best stock to buy right now based on Wall Street analysts' price targets. Meta Platforms ( META +0.59% ) stock has a median price target of $880 per share, representing 22% upside from today's share price. That beats any other stock with a market cap of $1 trillion or more. Here's why the Street is so bullish on Meta. Meta Platforms is spending big and winning big with AI Meta Platforms is one of the biggest spenders on artificial intelligence in the world. Management expects to spend roughly $67 billion on capital expenditures this year, most of that going toward building and outfitting AI data centers. While other hyperscalers are spending even more, Meta doesn't rent out any of its compute like the three big cloud computing giants. All that spend goes toward training and running its own AI. There's good reason for Meta to spend so much on AI: It could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of advances in generative AI in both the near and long term. In the near term, Meta's machine learning algorithms are essential for optimizing content feeds in its social media apps. The algorithms are responsible for both what content users see, what ads they see, and when they see it. The end result is a well-designed machine for maximizing time on its apps and ad revenue per minute spent on those apps. With the advancements of generative AI, Meta can supercharge its ad business. CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions generative AI getting to the point where an AI agent can practically manage advertising campaigns for a business, saying, \"Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve ... and how much they're willing to pay for each result, and then we just do the rest.\" Such a product would make it easier for small businesses to advertise on Facebook and Instagram and put more of their budgets toward winning customers instead of developing new ad campaigns. Putting AI in charge of ad creatives could also make them more effective, as Meta can tailor-make ads for each user in order to maximize conversions. In the long run, generative AI could be instrumental in expanding the use cases of augmented reality headsets. An AI-based user interface would not only allow users to interact with AI, but AI to interact with the user's environment. Meta is arguably the current leader in augmented reality and virtual reality technology, but AI could unlock a broader user base for its platform. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.59 %) $ 4.36 Current Price $ 738.36 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.15 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 9.2M Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Meta's stock valuation is still attractive Meta has seen excellent financial results even as it spends heavily on AI infrastructure. Revenue grew 22% last quarter, while operating margin expanded, resulting in 36% growth in net income. Meta also generates more than enough free cash flow to both invest in AI and buy back its shares , which means earnings per share grew somewhat faster, at 38%. But some may worry all that spending will catch up to Meta in the near future. As capital expenditures grow, so do deferred expenses (i.e., depreciation ). Those will hit Meta's income statement starting next year. Meta estimates the useful life of its non-AI and AI servers to average 5.5 years. But if Meta has to replace servers more quickly than that, it could cause a significant spike in expenses down the line as it adjusts its calculation and buys more AI chips. Meta is also reportedly paying hundreds of millions for top AI talent. Combined with the rising depreciation expenses, management is forecasting a sharp uptick in operating expenses next year. Still, strong revenue growth could more than offset it and support excellent earnings-per-share growth. Right now, analysts expect EPS growth to slow significantly in the back half of the year. Even so, they expect earnings to reaccelerate to double-digits in 2026 and 2027. Meanwhile, the stock trades for just 25 times analysts' expectations for 2026 earnings. That's a great price for a company that's well positioned to benefit from the advancements in AI and is spending in an effort to control its destiny in that regard. It's no wonder Wall Street analysts expect the stock to keep climbing over the next year.

The recent Financial Analyst Day highlighted even loftier long-term AI-driven targets, but the news also reinforced the most pressing short-term catalyst, ramping execution on multi-billion-dollar AI deals, while keeping the spotlight on operational risks stemming from Oracle’s aggressive capacity expansion.

This rollout is particularly significant in the context of Oracle’s near-term efforts to deliver on its massive AI infrastructure commitments, as success here is crucial for monetizing its rapidly growing performance obligations.

      "text": "Assessing Blue Owl Capital After $1.5B Portfolio Sale Amid Recent Price Swings Simply Wall St October 18, 2025 6 min read In this article: OWL META Thinking about what to do with Blue Owl Capital stock? You are not alone, especially after the recent turbulence. The past month has brought quite a ride. After tumbling roughly 13% in the last 30 days, Blue Owl’s shares managed a nearly 5% rebound just this week. These swings have kept both cautious investors and optimists watching closely, wondering if this is an opportunity or another sign to wait and see. It is not all just market noise, either. News that Blue Owl may raise $1.5B by restructuring its asset manager portfolio shows the company is pushing for big strategic moves. The announcement that Blue Owl will help lead Meta’s eye-popping $29B data center financing, committing $3B in equity, has also stirred talk about its long-term growth potential. Even major analysts are taking note, with BofA recently bumping Blue Owl’s price target higher while maintaining their Buy rating. Still, the story gets more complicated when you zoom out and see the year-to-date performance. Shares are down more than 31% since January, and nearly 30% over the last year. Interestingly, the longer three-year return is a hefty 105%. Of course, sharp price moves often signal shifts in how the market values a company. Right now, Blue Owl earns a valuation score of 1 out of 6 checks for being undervalued. That is not the strongest sign of a bargain, but numbers alone never tell the whole story. Next, let us break down these valuation checks and explore what they reveal, then look at a more robust way to judge Blue Owl’s true worth. Blue Owl Capital scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown . Approach 1: Blue Owl Capital Excess Returns Analysis The Excess Returns model evaluates a company by examining how much profit it generates above its cost of equity, based on how efficiently it reinvests shareholders’ funds. In Blue Owl Capital’s case, this approach uses historical return on equity and book value to estimate sustainable earnings and determine whether the company is creating meaningful value for investors beyond its capital costs. Book Value: $3.61 per share Stable EPS: $0.14 per share (Source: Median Return on Equity from the past 5 years.) Cost of Equity: $0.30 per share Excess Return: $-0.16 per share Average Return on Equity: 3.98% Stable Book Value: $3.53 per share (Source: Median Book Value from the past 5 years.) With a negative excess return, Blue Owl is not currently generating returns above its cost of capital, which is a warning sign for value-seeking investors. According to this model, the stock’s intrinsic value is significantly below its current price. The implied intrinsic discount from the Excess Returns valuation is -2621.8%, indicating the shares are extremely overvalued by this measure. Story Continues Result: OVERVALUED Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Blue Owl Capital. OWL Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025 Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Blue Owl Capital may be overvalued by 2621.8%. Find undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities. Approach 2: Blue Owl Capital Price vs Earnings Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a preferred valuation tool for profitable companies like Blue Owl Capital because it relates the share price directly to the underlying earnings, making it easier to gauge how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of profit. The “normal” or “fair” PE ratio a company might command depends not just on its earnings today, but also on what the market expects for future growth and the risks that could disrupt those expectations. Generally, faster growth and lower risk translate to a higher fair PE multiple, while slower growth and more uncertainty call for a lower one. Right now, Blue Owl Capital trades at a PE ratio of 139.7x. That is much higher than both the Capital Markets industry average of 25.4x and the average of similar peers, which clocks in at 13.5x. However, direct comparisons can be misleading because each company’s fundamentals and outlook are unique. This is where the Simply Wall St Fair Ratio comes in. Blue Owl’s fair PE ratio estimate is 52.0x. This number considers not just headline earnings, but also factors like the company’s growth profile, profit margins, risk traits, and overall size. By doing so, it provides a more tailored benchmark than industry or peer averages alone, allowing for a more nuanced judgment of value. Comparing Blue Owl’s current PE ratio to its Fair Ratio shows the stock is trading far above what is justified by its outlook and fundamentals. The actual PE (139.7x) is much greater than the Fair Ratio (52.0x), suggesting significant overvaluation. Result: OVERVALUED NYSE:OWL PE Ratio as at Oct 2025 PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth . Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Blue Owl Capital Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your perspective or story about a company, which you build based on the numbers you believe are likely, such as fair value, future revenue, earnings, and margins, connected to what you think will actually happen. Narratives link a company’s story to a specific financial forecast and fair value. This means you do not have to just accept broad estimates or analyst opinions; you can stake out your own view and see how it compares to the community. These are easy to use and accessible on Simply Wall St’s Community page, which is trusted by millions of investors to help them make personal, informed decisions about buying or selling based on how fair value compares to the current price. Best of all, Narratives are automatically kept up to date whenever big news or fresh earnings are announced, so your story stays relevant without extra work. For example, with Blue Owl Capital, some investors see its future fair value as high as $29.00 thanks to growth in digital infrastructure and evergreen funds. Others set a much more cautious target at just $21.00, reflecting concerns about execution risks and competition. Do you think there's more to the story for Blue Owl Capital?

Sam Boughedda October 18, 2025 1 min read In this article: GOOG META GOOGL OPAI.PVT Investing.com -- MoffettNathanson analysts told investors in a note this week that thye believe Meta may now be confronting a challenge similar to Alphabet’s after the launch of ChatGPT, as OpenAI’s latest video-generation model, Sora 2, “has placed Meta directly in OpenAI’s competitive sight.” “For much of this period, Meta appeared insulated from the ChatGPT threat,” the analysts wrote. The company was viewed as “a clear beneficiary of the AI race — leveraging its unmatched social network scale and deep ad ecosystem to accelerate monetization through AI-driven enhancements.” But they warned that “the once-uncontested AI ‘winner’ may now face its own platform threat.” MoffettNathanson noted that since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, Alphabet has been in the market’s cross hairs over fears that large language models could disrupt both web traffic and Google’s dominance in search. The firm remarked that Meta’s stock had largely avoided those concerns until now. The analysts explained that OpenAI’s Sora 2, which comes with a “short-form video app featuring feeds and messaging,” directly overlaps with Meta’s core businesses. Investors, they wrote, “may begin to question Meta’s relentless CAPEX cycle devoted to building out GPU and GenAI infrastructure, particularly if this spending precedes another round of under-monetized product expansion.” They added that each of Meta’s past major product transitions, from mobile to Stories to Reels, followed a pattern of “heavy investment and limited near-term monetization, followed by eventual success but not without an interim drag on stock performance.” “If so,” MoffettNathanson concluded, “Meta’s stock could again face temporary pressure — especially as its rivalry with OpenAI intensifies.” Related articles Is Meta facing its Alphabet–ChatGPT moment? 17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4 Silver: Global Markets Show Signs of a Gold-Like Bullish Run With $44 in Sight 查看留言 條款 及 私隱政策 Your Privacy Choices More Info"

      "text": "How the 'Willy Wonka of marketing' is using comedy on LinkedIn The stories you don't know about some of the world's best — and little-known — brands Rod Gilmour · Feature writer 18 October 2025 6 min read In this article: PEP WPP.L META GOOGL AAPL Henry Hayes is tasked with pushing out short-form videos on LinkedIn. In a recent LinkedIn post, Henry Hayes emerged from a park shrubbery as Henry V. Dressed in full armour, he issued a Q4 rallying call to camera on leads, ROIs, pipelines and trending campaigns using Shakespearean marketing speak . There can’t be many, if any, who have a head of marketing role quite like Hayes, but London startup Passionfruit does things differently to cut through the noise in an agency-dominated industry. Hired by the co-founder of a platform that matches companies with freelance marketing specialists, Hayes’ job is twofold: to look after the firm’s growing B2B events arm, as well as create comedy videos on LinkedIn to get the brand noticed and engage with global CMOs. Read More: Why do Dryrobe users irritate some people? “I basically realised I wanted to be the world’s No. 1 comedy marketer. There is a real need, isn’t there?” jokes Hayes, who made his name with viral sketches on London stereotypes. “But I also realised I’ve got a professional standpoint of eight years, which is important for LinkedIn, had a content creator background and brought an acting performance to it.” Launched in 2021, the marketing platform for independent workers places the best talent (only 12% are accepted onto the platform) with any Series A and above scale-up company. Passionfruit has 4,500 vetted freelancers and already has more than 250 global customers, which include PepsiCo ( PEP ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ). Passionfruit's head of marketing has seen an uptick in leads from video posts. Hayes is the face of the brand. Having studied English at the University of Warwick, he had no prior acting background and shunned any stage ambitions for a love of cricket and a student social life. He later worked at Red Bull as a student brand manager and turned to marketing after co-founding a university discount reward app called Orderu. A joint venture with a tech business in Asia ensued after the app gained 80,000 active users before being sold for a nominal fee during the pandemic. Hayes then took up a role in communications in the ebike industry and learned about performance marketing before finding himself at a crossroads two years ago. Told by friends that he had a skill for comedy, Hayes started producing observational skits on Londoners and \"corporate bros\", which gained millions of views across Instagram and TikTok. Passionfruit’s co-founder and CEO Raffi Salama contacted Hayes on the back of the success. Salama, a former fellow with advertising giant WPP's programme, had worked closely with David Beckham on Inter Miami CF's launch and realised there was a gap to help Gen Z freelancers with the increasing shift away from a 9-5 workplace. Story Continues Salama and chief product officer Issah Abdul-Moomin co-founded the firm in a coffee shop four years ago. The company has since raised over £9.5m investment as it looks for opportunity in mid-market enterprise and scaleups. Passionfruit co-founders Raffi Salama and Issah Abdul Moomin. Hayes says Passionfruit, which now employs around 50 staff in London, New York and Lisbon, had initial challenges in getting CMOs and marketing directors at big businesses to notice them. Salama asked Hayes if he would consider running curated marketing events to engage with VPs on what Passionfruit did as a business. Hayes is billed as ‘marketing’s Willy Wonka’ on LinkedIn for his profile photo, which, thanks to an AI specialist, captures him dressed in a purple suit with a yellow tie in front of Big Ben. \"LinkedIn photos are so drab,\" he smiles. After the first year where Passionfruit hosted over 20 events with 60% of its revenue hailing from the US, Hayes started creating comedy on LinkedIn at the start of 2025, with a team also helping him on the events side of the business. Read More: 'Our nut butter brand is on people's dating profiles — we're now courting £35m sales' He teamed up with creative strategist Ian McKenzie (a freelancer, naturally), who scrolls LinkedIn to collate the best gripes on the networking platform. In June, they also started monthly sketches, which have featured business marketing skits on Pride and Prejudice, The Bear and Succession. What started with 90% of leads with an average order of around £6,000 coming from marketing operations, Hayes’ content generates 65% of leads, which are then pushed to its events or meetings booked. “Even though we are a small company, we are a bit of a stormy beast,” said Hayes. “If CMOs only go on LinkedIn three times per month, we need to make sure we are at the top of their feed.” Before Passionfruit, Hayes said that performance marketing “used to run riot with Google and Meta running the show” around 2015. “The agencies with the biggest relationship won the day and their clients had the best run of the land on Google search and Meta ads,” he adds. Passionfruit helps companies collaborate with experienced freelancers. In today’s market, Passionfruit enables CMOs, marketing managers and C-suites at companies to be creative in a more organic, post-COVID world. “It allows them to focus on what really moves the needle, which is creative strategy and focusing on their brand,” he adds. In turn, says Hayes, Passionfruit removes the pain of hiring, administration and the aim of making the role more enjoyable for the modern-day marketer. In January, the company will officially roll out a new AI platform, which will be able to decipher the true value of transactions, deals and specialist rates across the industry. “It will bring back balance to a world which the big boys like WPP and Saatchi & Saatchi were out to disrupt, and have been overcharging brands on for years,” adds Hayes. Read More: ' Want to grow an iconic brand? CEOs have to value CMOs as servant leaders' “Our objective from a consumer standpoint is to make the world of work work for everyone.” Hayes will publish a Dodgeball skit next month as Passionfruit looks to make further inroads in the US. The marketing comic wouldn’t have it any other way, having been entrusted to enrich the brand. “The modern-day millennial gets chucked out to startup land believing they will make their millions, but it just doesn’t happen to 99%, who fail,\" he says. \"I feel that I am in that 1% at Passionfruit, and I’ve never really felt that in a startup before.\" Behind the brand: Henry Hayes on… Bringing the best out of marketers We do a lot of work with B2B marketers and how to be more personable and not shy away behind a HubSpot newsletter. That won’t move the needle. Marketing events today Out of nowhere, there is an F1 car, and if you win a raffle, you can sit in it for one minute.

Here’s what’s driving the buzz according to the most popular narrative among followers. Lemonade's heavy reliance on aggressive marketing spend and synthetic agent funding to acquire customers can increase operating leverage. However, if customer acquisition costs outpace customer lifetime value, this could pressure operating margins and delay the path to positive EBITDA. Read the complete narrative.

The 90,000-square-foot addition, privately financed, drew 128 elite guests from tech, finance, and energy sectors. Critics questioned whether donations from crypto and corporate leaders could translate into political influence or favors. Promo # Cryptocurrency Market News US President Donald Trump brought together some of the most influential names in crypto at a White House fundraiser this week. Coinbase, Ripple, Tether, and the Winklevoss twins prominently represented the industry. The gala unveiled plans for a massive new ballroom at the presidential residence, part of Trump’s privately funded expansion efforts. Guests were invited to contribute to the construction project. Sponsored Sponsored Crypto Heavyweights Join Trump’s Latest Gala Dinner Trump hosted 128 leading figures from business and finance at a gala on Wednesday. The event was part of his ongoing campaign to construct a $250 million ballroom for the White House. The dinner’s guest list notably featured several prominent figures from the cryptocurrency sector . Among them were representatives from Coinbase, Ripple, Tether, and the Winklevoss twins of the Gemini exchange. In addition to crypto, the event drew executives from major corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Palantir and representatives from telecom leaders T-Mobile and Comcast. Tobacco producers Altria and Reynolds American were also present. 🚨🇺🇸 TRUMP COURTS DONORS WITH WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM DINNER Trump has invited his biggest donors to a glitzy White House dinner celebrating the $250 million ballroom now under construction. The event pulls in a who’s who of financiers and power brokers eager to stay in the… https://t.co/Dn24Yro9S0 pic.twitter.com/1HGS28LF9d — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) October 16, 2025 The guest list also included several wealthy families and longtime Trump allies, including the Lutnick family , oil magnate Harold Hamm, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers owners Edward and Shari Glazer. The event quickly raised questions about how wealthy donors might use these contributions to gain influence over Trump. Sponsored Sponsored Privately Funded, Publicly Debated Over the summer, the Trump administration revealed plans for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom for the presidential residence’s East Wing. The White House said private donors, rather than taxpayers, will entirely finance the construction costs. Trump noted that the new venue would hold up to a thousand guests and feature bulletproof glass on all sides. Officials described the project as a long-awaited upgrade to accommodate large-scale events such as state dinners. Although it remains uncertain how many of the 128 attendees contributed, Trump reportedly thanked those present for donating “tremendous amounts of money.” He also stated that the project’s funding was already “fully taken care of.” The event quickly sparked criticism. Leaders like Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned whether Trump’s acceptance of ballroom donations could be tied to favorable treatment for attendees . What are these billionaires and giant corporations getting in exchange for donating to Donald Trump's $200 million ballroom? Do they think we're dumb enough to believe they're giving their money away for free? pic.twitter.com/4HoeJ7YjMx — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 15, 2025 Although YouTube representatives did not attend Wednesday’s gala, the platform agreed last month to contribute $22 million to the ballroom project as part of a settlement with Trump. The donation resolved a lawsuit he had filed against YouTube and its CEO over the temporary suspension of his account following the 2021 Capitol riot. The gathering also echoed Trump’s earlier private dinner at his Virginia golf club in May, organized for the top 220 holders of his meme coin . The 25 largest investors were also treated to a private tour of the White House. You might also like News TradFi 2 days ago Will President Trump Pardon FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Next?

Stock’s price target was raised to $380 from $360. Oracle lifted its fiscal 2030 cloud infrastructure revenue target by $22 billion to $166 billion at its investor day and disclosed a deal backlog topping $500 billion. It now projects total revenue of $225 billion and EPS of $21 for FY30. CEO Clay Magouyrk said new bookings were coming from not just OpenAI but a range of customers. Oracle’s most recent quarterly revenue growth of 11% has yet to reflect the 35% compound growth rate the company now guides for over the next four years, with UBS saying the upside not priced into the stock. The analysts also noted Oracle’s assurances that gross margins on GPU infrastructure are running at 30-40% over contract lifespans, better than feared, and highlighted potential pull-through demand for its database and SaaS businesses as AI adoption accelerates. Though the bulk of Oracle’s raised guidance begins in fiscal 2028, leaving limited upside to FY26-27 earnings, while execution on new AI infrastructure projects and reliance on large customers like OpenAI remain watch points. UBS raised its FY30 EPS estimate to $20.47 from $15.40 and applied a 44x multiple to its 2027 earnings forecast, calling that a justified premium to peers. At 15x FY30 earnings, Oracle shares remain “too cheap” “Oracle and its customers (OpenAI, Meta and xAI) need to deliver, but we remain BUY-rated on a belief that the stock can move higher as it executes on this guide acceleration,” analysts at UBS said.

Most Read from Bloomberg Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors Los Angeles County Declares State of Emergency Over ICE Raids There’s a Better Way to Win on Traffic Safety Trump Floats San Francisco as Next Target for Crime Crackdown NY Senator Behind Casino Push Urges Swift Awarding of Licenses In the two weeks since AMD and OpenAI announced their blockbuster deal, the chipmaker’s stock has soared more than 40%. AMD also landed a major order from Oracle Corp. this week, further juicing its shares. Meanwhile, Broadcom unveiled its own agreement with OpenAI on Monday, sending its shares up 10% in a single session, their best performance since April. But Nvidia is languishing, falling 3.5% since the AMD-OpenAI pact became public and underperforming the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which is essentially flat. “OpenAI clearly can’t rely just on Nvidia,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which has less than $70 million in assets under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “They have to do deals with as many people as they can because they have a voracious appetite for computing power.” Of course, none of this is meant to imply that Nvidia is losing its leadership position in AI infrastructure. The chip behemoth remains the 800-pound gorilla in the field, commanding roughly 95% of the total market, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. But as the industry expands there’s increasing room for more winners. Investors are now piling into those opportunities, giving the stocks a taste of the momentum that has propelled Nvidia over the past few years. “AMD and Broadcom already had their irons in the fire, but it does seem like they are getting more and more attention as more money is thrown into this area,” said Kevin Mahn, president and chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, which has $7 billion in assets under management and owns positions in Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. “Nvidia remains at the hub of the AI ecosystem, everyone else is playing catchup. But that doesn’t mean it is the only company worth investing in.” In many ways, OpenAI’s burst of spending is making the operator of ChatGPT the new kingmaker in tech. “The industry really wants a substantive alternative to Nvidia, and it seems like AMD has arrived,” said Jason Tauber, co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Disrupters ETF (NBDS), which has $29 million in assets under management and holds Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. “The OpenAI deal was important validation that this is real.” Story Continues OpenAI is hardly the only company throwing around cash and chasing the AI wave. The tech industry is awash in billions of dollars in spending to build the infrastructure to power the technology, as many companies are worried that if they don’t keep up in the burgeoning arms race they’ll fall behind their competitors. But while these expenditures are a boon for companies like AMD, Broadcom and Nvidia, they’re also triggering concerns about the health of the AI trade that’s lifted the broader market in the last few years. As long as demand continues to outstrip supply, which is the driving force behind many of the deals struck lately, there should be room for multiple players in the space. The trouble is OpenAI is closely held, so it doesn’t have to answer to investors or file quarterly updates on its financial health. As a result, no one really knows how deep its pockets are or when things will start to get tight as it pays up on the more than $1 trillion of commitments it has made through 2030. “Everyone should remain highly skeptical about whether OpenAI can deliver on the extraordinary obligations it has taken on,” Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. “Considering all the companies involved, each carries significant exposure to OpenAI, and all will face repercussions if problems emerge down the line.” That’s a risk investors will need to watch. In the meantime, as long as the spigot of AI cash keeps flowing, Nvidia’s competitors like AMD and Broadcom will continue to bring opportunities to diversify away from the biggest player. “The sense of competition and other companies winning deals is very much welcome,” Hennion & Walsh’s Mahn said. “Investors now have more opportunity to not be concentrated in any single name. They can diversify into other chipmakers.” Tech Chart of the Day Nintendo Co. has asked suppliers to produce as many as 25 million units of the Switch 2 by the end of March 2026, setting the company up for record first-year sales of a console that’s already reached high-water marks for the global gaming sector. Top Tech Stories Apple Inc. is preparing to finally launch a touch-screen version of its Mac computer, reversing course on a stance that dates back to co-founder Steve Jobs. Oracle Corp. gave its expectations for gross margins for large AI infrastructure projects, easing some of Wall Street’s concerns about the profitability of a crucial new business unit. Automakers are bracing for fresh potential chip disruption, with China’s retaliatory export controls on an obscure Dutch supplier threatening to set off a chain reaction that could halt production lines. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms Inc. is set to seal an almost $30 billion financing package for its data center site in rural Louisiana, marking the final step for the largest private capital deal on record.

      "text": "Can Oracle's Expanding Contract Pipeline Drive Its Next Growth Phase? Zacks Equity Research October 17, 2025 3 min read In this article: ORCL META OPAI.PVT NVDA AMD Oracle ORCL is gearing up for its next phase of growth, backed by an expanding contract pipeline and a surge in demand for cloud and AI infrastructure. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management disclosed several multi-billion-dollar deals with top AI leaders, including OpenAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD and xAI, underscoring the company’s rising influence in the AI infrastructure space. These contracts have already translated into a 359% year-over-year surge in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) and are expected to exceed half a trillion dollars in the coming quarters. Oracle shares closed up 3% on Thursday as it called for more business in core categories and confirmed a cloud-computing deal with social media giant Meta. The maker of database software sees $20 billion in artificial intelligence-powered database and AI data platform revenues in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2025 and $3 billion in fiscal 2026. Recently, Oracle and Google Cloud have expanded their partnership to bring Google’s Gemini 2.5 and other advanced AI models to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) via Vertex AI, covering video, image, speech, music and industry models like MedLM. Oracle’s outlook remains ambitious. Management projects OCI revenues will grow 77% to $18 billion in fiscal 2026, with the long-term plan to reach $144 billion by 2030, most of which is already secured through existing agreements. The Zacks model reflects similar optimism, forecasting total revenue growth of 16.5% in fiscal 2026 and 21.7% in fiscal 2027. With a swelling backlog, deep AI partnerships and multi-cloud expansion, Oracle’s contract pipeline appears well-positioned to power sustained, long-term growth. How Rivals Stack Up Against Oracle Alphabet ’s GOOGL expanding cloud and AI ecosystem continues to strengthen its competitive edge over Oracle. As of June 30, 2025, Alphabet reported a $108.2 billion revenue backlog, primarily driven by Google Cloud. Alphabet expects to recognize 55% of this backlog within 24 months. Major wins like Meta’s $10 billion AI deal and TCS’ partnership expansion underscore Alphabet’s accelerating enterprise adoption and growing leadership in AI infrastructure. Microsoft MSFT remains Oracle’s fiercest rival, backed by a $368 billion commercial RPO, up 37% year over year in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, reflecting a strong and expanding contract pipeline. Fueled by surging demand for Azure and Copilot, Microsoft continues to secure major AI and cloud deals, including a recent $14 billion agreement with Nscale for 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs. Its scale, AI depth and global reach solidify enduring leadership in enterprise cloud. Story Continues ORCL’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Oracle have surged 83.7% year to date, outperforming both the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 23% and the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s rise of 19.9%. ORCL’s YTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, ORCL stock is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 42.91x, which is higher than the industry average of 33.01x. Oracle carries a Value Score of D. ORCL’s Valuation Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $6.77 per share, marking an upward revision of two cents over the past 30 days. The earnings figure suggests 12.27% growth over the figure reported in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia ( NVDA ) shares swing down then recover some ground ahead of the open. Meta ( META ) is close to a $30 billion financing deal for a data center in Louisiana, and shares of its AI glasses partner EssilorLuxottica ( EL.PA ) hit a new record. Micron ( MU ) abandons some of its chip supplying activities in China. Other top gainers and losers include Praxis ( PRAX ) and Rigetti ( RGTI ). For more live coverage of markets watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and head to Yahoo Finance . Video Transcript 00:09 Speaker A It's time now for today's trending tickers. We start with Tesla, which is continuing to fall in the pre-market after a tough session yesterday. 00:20 Speaker A Sentiment among investors is mixed to say the least, following another bearing report from analysts at BNP Pariba yesterday, even as Tesla sold more cars last quarter, as people were rushing to take advantage of the expiring tax credit. 00:32 Speaker A Tesla's valuation is based on Elon Musk's big promises for robots and AI, and for now, those promises still haven't materialized into anything concrete. 00:43 Speaker A Next up, Nvidia, and this will be seen as a key indicator for the whole stock market today to see if fears around regional banks spill into the pillars of the AI boom. 00:54 Speaker A The world's largest company has shown strong performance in recent weeks despite headwinds from geopolitical tensions, but it's dropped more than two and a half 1. 1.3% overnight. And of course, whatever happens to Nvidia today, will have an outsized impact on the rest of the stock market. 01:07 Speaker A Now, let's look at another tech giant, Meta. It's also in the red, and this follows the news from Bloomberg that Meta is close to clinching a $30 billion financing deal for a giant data center in Central Louisiana. 01:21 Speaker A That huge funding may come from Morgan Stanley. And this morning, with everything that's happening with banks, some investors might be worried about the massive size of this project, which also involves Blue Owl Capital. 01:32 Speaker A On the other hand, a key partner of Meta is hitting new record highs. Today in Paris, SLOR Luxottico, the world's leading maker of glasses, posted a sales beat driven by the success of Meta's AI smart glasses. 01:45 Speaker A And if you've been following AI news, you will be interested in Micron. Shares in the US chipmaker were in the red in pre-market trading after Reuters reported that the US chipmaker plans to cease supplying server chips to data centers in China following a prolonged business slump linked to a 2023 government ban. 02:03 Speaker A China accounted for around 12% of Micron's total revenue in the last fiscal year. 02:08 Speaker A Okay, let's move on to Quantum computing now. very briefly, the key thing you need to know is that Ragetti, which has been driven by speculation around quantum computers, is in free fall in the pre-market after it already lost nearly 15% in yesterday's session. 02:22 Speaker A Investors are worried about weak fundamentals. 02:26 Speaker A And before we go, write down this name. It's a stock that's almost tripled in value in the past 24 hours. Praxis precision medicines was the number one trending ticker on Yahoo Finance this Friday morning after the clinical stage bio phaceutical company unveiled plans to raise more than $500 million through a public share offering.

Investment Thesis Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META) open-weight Llama strategy is meant to add revenues, not be a non-profit. By allowing for a stable foundation model, these efforts permit Meta to maximise builder dollars while limiting brand and safety risk. This ecosystem is laid against Meta's own offering: Meta AI's billion users build signals, add advertisements and ranking models, messaging bots monetize; higher advertisement yields, supplemental non-feed revenue, with costs per inferences dropping permits a transition from momentum to operating leverage. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META. Is META fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Q2 Performance META: Is This The Next Gushing Stream Of Revenue? Meta's Q2'25 shows extraordinary, ad-based resurgence: $47.5B in total revenues was up ~22% y/y (vs. $39.1B Q2'24) and up ~12% q/q with $46.6B (call it ~98% of revs), of advertising revenues. Revenues in \"Other\" areas of Family of Apps are still increasing by a healthy $583M and increasing at faster rates y/y than ads meaning WhatsApp paid messaging and verification must be starting to be perceived as whole given set of offerings, if at very low scale today. Reality Labs revenues are a bit lumpish ($370M) with clear holiday bumps (Q4) and little momentum q/q, while again operating losses try $4.5B again this quarter, showing a sustainable long payback risk. With all that, Family of Apps (FOA) operating income rose to $25.0B while group operating margin jumped to 43% (vs. 38% y/y), a clear sign that both ad productivity from AI stimuli and cost discipline was such as to more than offset RL outlapy. Seasonality is Real (Q4 is qtr. of highest sales), but year of year margin improvements indicate some structural, efficiency benefits not just seasonal lift. Important watchouts: live or die by ads, durability of cost where there invented improvements per ad, and can RL change losses w/o giving up current hardware /AI roadmaps. All in all, high quality, margin enhancing quarter. Q3 Outlook Q3'25 is likely to extend Q2's ad-led momentum, but with normal pre-holiday seasonality. Anticipate low-to-mid single-digit sequential revenue growth and high-teens y/o/y as AI-enhanced ranking/creative improvement enable price increases as impressions rise marginally. Other (WhatsApp paid messaging + Meta Verified) likely outgrows ads again off a small base, benefitting from further rollout of business-messaging flows. Threads adds incremental, brand-safe inventory, but monetization is still nascent. Reality Labs revenue should remain muted before Q4 hardware season, and operating losses roughly in a $4.5B run-rate continue to be the main drag on P&L. Mix and cost discipline should keep group operating margin in the low-40s despite depreciation from AI buildouts. Key swing factors: macro ad demand, Reels time-spent vs TikTok/YouTube, European policy frictions; none appear to derail the base cadence. The larger step-up comes in Q4 with holiday budgets, but December 16 chat-signal policy (ex-UK/EU/SK) sets up 2026 for an additional relevance-based pricing boost, assuming solid execution. Story Continues Guru Investments As of Q2 2025, Meta is a highly-convicted core position for Tiger Global, which has about 7.53 million shares valued near $5.34 billion, or about 15.3% of its equity portfolio and its single largest holding; Tiger added ~0.9% to its stake in the quarter. Fisher Asset Management ( Ken Fisher ( Trades , Portfolio )) owns about 6.36 million shares valued near $4.5 billion, or ~1.6% portfolio weight within a broadly diversified mega-cap tech book, after trimming the position by ~1.5% in Q2 2025. Baillie Gifford ( Trades , Portfolio ) owns about 5.45 million shares valued near $3.86 billion, or ~2.8% of assets; it reduced the position by ~7.1% in Q2 2025. Together these core snapshots reflect three distinct stances: Tiger's concentrated conviction, Fisher's size but more measured exposure, and Baillie Gifford ( Trades , Portfolio )'s growth-oriented but also actively-managed allocation. Dollar values fluctuate with share price of Meta and reflect managers' latest reported holdings. The Brewing Revenue Potential While Meta claims their form of open is open source, in fact it is open weights. By releasing provably strong base models under a community license combined with acceptable use policy, developers can easily fine-tune and deploy Llama without having to pay for pretraining, allowing Meta to maintain landmines and brand safety. This practically oriented, carefully strategized building with Llama low-friction while allowing Meta strategic control. That's why Institutional enterprises and large platforms can safely adopt Llama while the purists tangle over definitions. The Nuanced Structure of Llama Credibility is gasoline. Meta kept delivering credible families: Llama 3.1 with an emblematic 405B parameter model that standardized state-of-art but open-weights. Llama 3.2 following with vision models (11B/90B) and small (1B/3B) text models that operate at the edge. In 2025, the Llama 4 herd emerged with text-to-text & text-to-vision natively multimodal models with extensive context, demonstrating the cadence is not a sprint. The clear signal for developers is you can risk your stack by going Llama without getting stuck on last year's model. Distribution creates momentum from gasoline. Since the weights are interchangeable weights, hyperscalers and data platforms are racing to promote Llama to first-class citizen status. Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Databricks are all deploying the family, creating a developer experience that is Llama wherever they are using Llama AWS Consoles, GCP Notebooks, Lakehouse pipelines no stack changes needed. Every point of integration is free distribution and product-market validation for Meta. Standardization creates a compound ecosystem from momentum. Llama Stack provides a reference distribution that contains a standard reference toolkit, APIs, tuning, safety layers, and agentic apps across environments, which OEMs (Dell, AI Alliance members) and community utilize as a reference distribution. This reduces the toil of integration and scales the skills base and greatly simplifies third-party innovation for Meta to reintegrate. The Commercialization of the Llama Apparatus Portability maximizes the surface area for invention. Llama's small models and vision variants address edge, and low signaling cases right on time for more, and hapless use cases on Meta's increasingly available devices. An extreme use case is Space Llama, a tuned Llama 3.2, which was offline on the ISS, an extreme case of why open weights and small apps matter. The more distribution of Llama, the more novel workflows the community innovates for Meta to utilize internally. Meta AI as a product has about ~1B monthly actives on the Family of Apps and provides an unmatched feedback flywheel of developing models and experience overall. Starting 16 December 2025 (not including UK/ EU/ SK), Meta AI interactions provide preference signal to content and advertisement personalization and essentially Creating Assistant usage into relevance signals. That is the fastest fast-list from open-weight strategy to monetized outputs, because it closely connects model enhancements and assistant performance to ad revenue. Now, the business math. In the short term, monetization isn't from charging developers for Llama. Monetization happens from momentum in the ecosystem leading to Meta's core products being better and cheaper to run. The better models that are discovered and stress-tested in the wild contribute to ranking, creative tools, and integrity, improving conversion without increasing ad load. We can already see the macro impact happening in Q2 FY25, average price per "

      "text": "3 Growth Stocks Wall Street Might Be Sleeping On, but I'm Not By James Brumley – Oct 17, 2025 at 4:05AM Key Points Although Dutch Bros' expansion plans may look and feel overly aggressive, they actually make a lot of sense given one huge detail. The doubt surrounding DraftKings ignores a couple of important factors. Snapchat may never be as big as X or Facebook, but the company understands how important it is at this time to be different. NYSE : BROS Dutch Bros Market Cap $7.2B Today's Change angle-down ( -0.40 %) $ 0.23 Current Price $ 56.91 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET In this case, weakness isn't a warning as much as it is a simple, short-sighted mistake. Most of the time the market gets it right. In other words, investors and analysts alike usually price a stock appropriately based on the underlying company's potential and prospects. You just have to allow for a bit of predictable volatility. Every now and then though, Wall Street, as well as Main Street, misses the mark. That is to say, the market lets a stock linger at a price that underestimates its upside. Here's a closer look at three such names right now that I'd consider adding to a portfolio before the market unwinds the discount. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Dutch Bros It's been a tough year for Dutch Bros ( BROS 0.40% ) shareholders. The stock soared between last October and February 2025, fueled by bullish hopes following a fantastic fiscal third quarter 2024, when revenue jumped 28% year over year. But the up-and-coming chain of coffee kiosks just wasn't able to recreate that magic. The stock's more than 40% below February's peak, weighed down by the reality of its expansion plans. Expand NYSE : BROS Dutch Bros Today's Change ( -0.40 %) $ -0.23 Current Price $ 56.91 Key Data Points Market Cap $7B Day's Range $ 56.40 - $ 58.39 52wk Range $ 32.68 - $ 86.88 Volume 2.8M Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 26.59 % Dividend Yield N/A Those realities are cost and time. Although the company recently upped its long-term target store count from 4,000 to more than 7,000 (versus a little more than 1,000 right now) investors aren't exactly thrilled with the way spending is taking a toll on the bottom line, and the minimal impact it's making on revenue growth right now. Just take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Sure, the company could spend less and boast a bigger, better bottom line. This is arguably the time to be aggressive, though. Rival Starbucks is on the ropes for reasons ranging from labor headaches to shifts in consumer preferences to brand fatigue to sheer saturation. Dutch Bros has a chance to steal market share . However, it will want to do so quickly before Starbucks regroups and counters its younger competitor's growth. It may be costly for Dutch Bros, but it will arguably be worth the short-term frustration in the long run. In fact, it may not even take a long time for Dutch Bros' long-term upside to begin being reflected in its share price. Despite this year's persistent weakness, the vast majority of the analyst community still suggests the company's stock is a strong buy, maintaining a 12-month consensus price target of $81.59 that's more than 50% above the stock's current price. 2. DraftKings DraftKings ( DKNG 4.90% ) is primarily an online sports-betting platform. Although its roots are in fantasy sports (which it still does), since the U.S Supreme Court lifted the ban on sports wagering back in 2018, this company's chief profit center has become sports betting in states where offering the service via a mobile app is possible. In Q2 of this year, DraftKings' sportsbook handle grew 8.7% to just under $1 billion. It's inched into the online casino business as well, with Q2's casino revenue improving 23% to reach $430 million. Both extend long-lived growth streaks driven by a combination of a growing number of states that permit such online wagering as well as the continued development of established markets. This pace of growth hasn't proved all that convincing to most investors of late. After soaring during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic and then peeling back as the lockdown efforts wound down, the 2023 bounce-back waned at the beginning of 2024. The stock's been stuck there ever since. Investors are concerned that the company may be running out of states to set up shop, while at the same time faces improving competition including unlikely betting sites like Kalshi. And to be fair, these are legitimate concerns. These concerns look past a couple of important bullish details about DraftKings, however. First, while it's true there is a structural limit to how much business DraftKings can do, it's nowhere near there. As of the latest look, Legal Sports Report says only 30 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico allow online sports wagering , with California and Texas notably missing from this list. We've also seen that it can take several years to fully cultivate a market once this company begins operations in a particular state. It's possible DraftKings still hasn't reached its maximum revenue potential even in the states where it's offered sports-based betting the longest. The other bullish detail to consider is simply that DraftKings owns one of the premier names -- if not the premier name -- in the business, whether you're talking about wagering, fantasy sports, or licensing partnerships with professional sports teams, casinos, and even media companies. For instance, DraftKings recently entered an advertising relationship with NBCUniversal's sports arm, showcasing all the ways its brand name can be monetized. 3. Snap Finally, add Snap ( SNAP +1.02% ) to your list of stocks worth a look while Wall Street's seemingly forgotten about them. This one's down 90% from its 2021 peak as well as more than 15% under analysts' consensus price target of $9.21, seemingly stuck in neutral since the middle of 2022. Expand NYSE : SNAP Snap Today's Change ( 1.02 %) $ 0.08 Current Price $ 7.95 Key Data Points Market Cap $13B Day's Range $ 7.80 - $ 8.03 52wk Range $ 6.90 - $ 13.28 Volume 48M Avg Vol 91M Gross Margin 51.14 % Dividend Yield N/A It's not too tough to figure out the disinterest. Between Meta Platforms ' Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, plus X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and a slew of others, the last thing the world needs it yet another social networking site. And yet, Snapchat's parent is clearly doing something right. Revenue through the first half of this year is up a little more than 11%, extending growth that was rekindled in 2023 at a pace that's expected to last at least through next year on the heels of healthy -- even if not thrilling -- user growth. What gives? As it turns out, perhaps another social media site is exactly what the world needs after all, although it might be more accurate to say it needs a different kind of social networking platform. Whereas X and Facebook remain relatively toxic to the point of being unenjoyable, Snapchat users remain rather well shielded from posts and people they're looking to avoid. That's because there is no \"news feed\" featured at the center of users' interface. Rather, Snapchat users generally only see and engage with approved friends. The company even recently highlighted a research study suggesting \"[in contrast to other platforms], a higher number of hours on Snapchat was not found to be significantly associated with any of the mental health symptoms examined.\" This doesn't mean to look for a sudden rush of new users from Facebook or TikTok, or another other social networking site. If there's been no surge yet, there's not going to be one. Instead, look for a measured, persistent flow of new users who have grown weary of other social media platforms. Advertisers, of course, will follow this crowd, particularly now that it offers such specific tools like the App Power Pack, intended to spur downloads of an advertiser's app. About the Author James Brumley is a contributing Motley Fool stock market "

      "text": "Why Meta Platforms' Open-Source AI Strategy Might Win the Long Game By Lawrence Nga – Oct 17, 2025 at 4:00AM Key Points Meta Platforms’ open-source strategy encourages global developers and enterprises to innovate on its foundation. If Llama becomes the preferred model for developers, it could emerge as the standard for artificial intelligence (AI). Llama could open up new monetization avenues in the coming years. NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Market Cap $1.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Meta Platforms' open-source approach might look risky in the short term, but it could prove brilliant in the long run. The artificial intelligence (AI) race has become one of the most defining competitions in tech history -- and for now, OpenAI's ChatGPT sits firmly in the spotlight. But while OpenAI monetizes its models through subscriptions and partnerships, Meta Platforms ( META +0.64% ) is taking a very different path. Instead of building a walled garden, Meta is betting on open-source collaboration through its Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) family of models. It's a move that might not dominate headlines, but it could prove far more disruptive in the long run. Here's why Meta's open approach could quietly shape the foundation of the next generation of AI and give the company a durable advantage that others can't easily replicate. Llama: Meta's dark horse in the AI ecosystem At first glance, Meta's large language model Llama doesn't look like a commercial product. It's freely available to researchers and developers, lacks a flashy consumer-facing app like ChatGPT, and doesn't directly drive revenue. But under the surface, it's a powerful strategic weapon. By releasing its models openly -- from Llama 2 in 2023 to Llama 3 in 2024 and the latest Llama 4 in 2025 -- Meta is embedding its technology into the fabric of the global AI community. Thousands of start-ups, developers, and enterprises are building applications, copilots, and chatbots powered by Llama models. That means that while OpenAI and Anthropic control their ecosystems, Meta is influencing everyone else's. Every time a company deploys a Llama-based model, Meta's frameworks, optimization tools, and developer APIs gain relevance -- creating a network effect that compounds over time. In other words, Llama is Meta's silent distribution engine for AI dominance. Expand NASDAQ : META Meta Platforms Today's Change ( 0.64 %) $ 4.67 Current Price $ 738.67 Key Data Points Market Cap $1855B Day's Range $ 731.17 - $ 741.21 52wk Range $ 479.80 - $ 796.25 Volume 662K Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 81.95 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Open source as a strategy The open-source strategy does more than attract goodwill -- it creates leverage. OpenAI, Alphabet 's Google, and Anthropic must fund massive compute costs to serve every query through their proprietary APIs. Meta, by contrast, shifts that cost outward since developers using Llama models handle their own deployment and infrastructure. That makes Meta's approach capital efficient and its ecosystem expansive. The payoff is twofold: Faster innovation: Thousands of developers can adapt and fine-tune Llama for niche use cases, from healthcare chatbots to financial modeling tools. Lower customer acquisition cost: Each open deployment extends Meta's influence without requiring Meta to sell or serve that customer directly. If Llama becomes the preferred model for developers, it could emerge as the standard for AI, much like Android became the standard for smartphones. That's the power of scale through openness, and it's the kind of moat that builds quietly before it becomes visible in the numbers. Besides, while open models lagged behind closed ones a few years ago, that gap is closing quickly. Benchmarks from Meta's latest model, Llama 4, show it competing head to head with GPT-4 on multiple fronts while being significantly smaller and more efficient to run. Reports suggest Llama 4 \"Maverick\" delivers inference costs as low as 10% of GPT-4o's -- a stunning leap in efficiency. The long-term business logic To investors, Meta's open-source push might look altruistic, but it's deeply strategic. Every developer using Llama indirectly strengthens Meta's core businesses -- from cloud partnerships and hardware demand (think Nvidia GPU training clusters) to better AI integration across Meta's own products. When Llama improves, Meta's internal assistants (like those in WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger) get better too. Those improvements feed engagement, which drives ad revenue, which is still Meta's financial engine. By lowering the barriers for AI adoption, Meta isn't just competing with closed models like OpenAI -- it's expanding the total market and positioning itself as the backbone of global AI development. Doing so should open up new monetization avenues in the coming years, most of which don't exist today. What does it mean for investors? OpenAI may have captured the public's imagination, but Meta is quietly trying to build the rails that everyone else will run on. By pairing world-class infrastructure with open-source models, Meta has positioned Llama not as a rival to ChatGPT but as a platform for everyone else. That strategy could make Meta one of the most influential players in the AI ecosystem over the next decade. Investors should watch how this strategy evolves over time because it could make Meta not just an AI winner but a sustainable long-term growth stock.

      "text": "Better Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon By Patrick Sanders – Oct 17, 2025 at 3:50AM Key Points Amazon's cloud computing division is growing and becoming a bigger driver of profits. Apple's services segment has an outstanding profit margin. NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Market Cap $3.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.25 %) $ 3.25 Current Price $ 262.83 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Both members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are just treading water this year. The \"Magnificent Seven\" cadre of stocks are among some of the best on Wall Street. The group of seven companies -- Alphabet , Amazon ( AMZN +1.43% ) , Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia , and Tesla -- represents megacap companies that are market leaders in their fields, are innovative, and have a strong financial performance. It's not surprising that each of these companies have a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Amazon and Apple are two household names that have a lot in common. Both companies succeed because they have developed huge ecosystems that give them undeniable advantages over their competitors. They disrupted the e-commerce and telecommunications markets, respectively, and became market leaders. Despite their huge sizes, both do an outstanding job of offering personalized experiences that solidify customer loyalty. It's not all rosy, though. Amazon and Apple have been the worst-performing members of the Magnificent Seven so far this year, struggling to stay in the black. As we turn toward the fourth quarter of 2025, which of these companies is the better investment today? Amazon Is Amazon an e-commerce company or a cloud computing powerhouse? Why not both? The e-commerce division is perhaps where Amazon is best known. After all, it's nearly impossible not to see all those distinctive blue Amazon delivery trucks on the road every day. Amazon generated $167.7 billion in sales in Q3, with most of those coming from the company's e-commerce efforts. Amazon saw $100.1 billion of sales in North America, up 11% from a year ago and $36.8 billion in international sales, up 16%. While those numbers are great, the profit margin isn't. Operating expenses for the Amazon.com website was $127.8 billion, leaving the company with only $9.3 billion in profit for its e-commerce efforts. A better business is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division, which generated $30.8 billion in sales and $20.7 billion in operating expenses , giving it a clean profit of $10.16 billion. That's up from $9.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Expand NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Today's Change ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Key Data Points Market Cap $2391B Day's Range $ 221.91 - $ 225.40 52wk Range $ 161.38 - $ 242.52 Volume 1.6M Avg Vol 44M Gross Margin 49.61 % Dividend Yield N/A AWS is the dominant cloud computing platform in the world, holding a 30% market share, topping Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud (13%). Cloud computing is becoming more important as companies around the world seek to run critical operations on a cloud or hybrid cloud environment. The AWS infrastructure is critical for companies looking for virtual services, storage, and networking solutions without investing in costly data centers on their own. Amazon stock carries a pricey 32.8 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio . But when you consider that at the beginning of 2024, the P/E was more than 50, Amazon stock looks more appealing. Apple Like Amazon, Apple is best known for its core product -- iPhones, which make up the biggest chunk of company revenue. But it's the services segment that makes me most interested in Apple stock because services is where the money comes from. Apple's products, including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, wearables, and smarthome products, generated $66.6 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2025's Q3 and $43.6 billion in operating expenses, giving it roughly a 36% profit margin for those sales. Meanwhile, the services segment generated $27.42 billion in revenue and only $6.7 billion in operating expenses. That's a profit margin of better than 75%, which makes sense because the services segment, including Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Pay, iCloud, and the lucrative App Store, doesn't have the costs of designing, building, and selling. Expand NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Today's Change ( 1.25 %) $ 3.25 Current Price $ 262.83 Key Data Points Market Cap $3900B Day's Range $ 259.20 - $ 264.13 52wk Range $ 169.21 - $ 265.29 Volume 1.9M Avg Vol 55M Gross Margin 46.68 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % And it should be noted that Q3 in general was a badly needed strong showing for Apple. The company's revenue stagnated in recent quarters thanks to market saturation and rising competition in China, but in Q3 the company's revenue was up 10% to $94 billion. Earnings per share were $1.57, up 12% from a year ago. Apple is hoping for strong performance from its newly released iPhone 17 line, but I don't know if it will happen. The company's most recent phones improve battery life, camera performance, and storage. But that's a far cry from the iPhone improvements of the past, which included revolutionary advances like touchscreens, the Siri voice assistant, and facial recognition. Apple stock trades at a forward P/E of nearly 31, similar to Amazon. The verdict Both of these are solid companies. They both belong in the Magnificent Seven, and both should continue to reward their investors. And they both have some advantages. While they have similar P/E ratios, Amazon has a significantly better forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 versus Apple's 8.3.  Apple, meanwhile, pays a small quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share annually, which equates to a yield of 0.4%. Amazon doesn't pay a dividend. But if you have to pick just one, the choice is Amazon. I appreciate the growing cloud computing division. While there are serious challengers from Alphabet and Microsoft, the cloud computing market share is expected to grow from $752.4 billion in 2024 to $2.39 trillion by 2030, for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.4%. That kind of growth engine is impossible to ignore, which is why I think Amazon is the better stock for buy-and-hold investors.

      "text": "Ray-Ban maker shares hits all-time high as investors bet on Meta AI glasses boom Gianluca Lo Nostro and Elisa Anzolin October 17, 2025 3 min read In this article: EL.PA META By Gianluca Lo Nostro and Elisa Anzolin (Reuters) -Shares in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica rose 14% to hit an all-time high on Friday, adding nearly $20 billion in market value as investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses gathered momentum. The Paris-listed group, founded by late Italian entrepreneur Leonardo Del Vecchio and a possible contender in the race to buy fashion group Armani, reported on Thursday third-quarter sales growth of 11.7% from a year ago to 6.9 billion euros ($8.1 billion). The results beat expectations and marked the company's best quarterly performance ever amid strong demand for wearable products such as the smart glasses it has been developing with Meta since before the pandemic. Even though the smart glasses business has until now accounted for only a fraction of EssilorLuxottica's total revenue, it has become a focal point for analysts and investors, as well as a catalyst for the company's investments. Barclays analysts have predicted smart glasses could become the most disruptive innovation since mobile phones, forecasting 60 million units sold globally by 2035. The AI-powered glasses contributed over four percentage points to sales growth, said Chief Financial Officer Stefano Grassi, with demand prompting EssilorLuxottica to accelerate production capacity plans for the glasses ahead of schedule. \"The exponential growth of wearables provided an extra-boost to the top line performance,\" the company said in a statement on Thursday. SHARES POST BIGGEST DAILY RISE SINCE 2008 EssilorLuxottica's shares were up 13.8% by 1400GMT, the biggest daily gain since 2008, lifting the company's market capitalisation to 126.5 billion euros. The move drove the European luxury benchmark Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 up over 7% on the week, the index's biggest weekly gain since January. The latest Ray-Ban Meta models, priced from $379 to $799 for a new flagship version with built-in display, are currently sold in limited physical stores with expansion to Canada, France, Italy and Britain planned for early 2026. The emerging success of Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses has reignited a long dead category of eyewear computers as Google and Microsoft had previously abandoned the market. By marrying upgraded cameras and generative AI features with Ray-Ban's designs, Meta has lured big tech rivals back into the market. Google and Samsung are working on glasses based on the Android XR platform. Apple is reportedly working on smart glasses. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to investors the smart glasses were now a \"material growth driver\" while the company's core business remained resilient. Story Continues Equita analysts upgraded their annual revenue forecast for wearables, and now expect an impact on the group's sales of about one billion euro this year, according to a research note. \"The acceleration in third-quarter revenues and the level of confidence expressed on fourth-quarter and mid-term prospects are an important indicator of the success of the group's strategic drivers,\" they said.

The company will split ownership of the Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, with Blue Owl Capital Inc. Metal will retain a 20% stake in the venture, Bloomberg reported. Funding for the site comes from Morgan Stanley, which arranged over $27 billion of debt and about $2.5 billion of equity into a special purpose vehicle. Thursday’s report comes amid continued, outsized spending by Meta and its peers on building out more data center capacity for their AI ambitions. Meta has been aggressively poaching talent and acquiring computing capacity in recent months. The company said on Wednesday it will invest $1.5 billion to build a data center in Texas.
