These powerful new products and strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 17 in places like China often make people excited about a company's future, potentially leading to higher sales and an increase in its \"stock\" (a share of ownership in the company). However, there are also some concerns, as Apple has lost key talent in its AI division and is navigating ongoing trade tensions with China, a huge market for its products. While successful chip suppliers, like TSMC (who makes chips for Apple), are seeing a boom from AI, these internal talent losses and external political hurdles could make investors wary and affect Apple's stock value.",

ELD Asset Management: Apple in Talks to Buy Prompt AI PR Newswire October 16, 2025 2 min read In this article: AAPL SINGAPORE , Oct. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ELD Asset Management has released an assessment of Apple Inc.'s ongoing negotiations to acquire Prompt AI, identifying the potential deal as a focused transaction aimed at enhancing on-device intelligence and strengthening developer-facing tools. The firm notes that in Q3 2025, competition for specialized AI assets has intensified, with market participants closely monitoring valuation strategies, potential integration into HomeKit workflows, and the broader transition from consumer-facing applications to platform-level capabilities. These factors, according to ELD, are continuing to influence investor sentiment in real time. ELD Asset Management: Apple in Talks to Buy Prompt AI (PRNewsfoto/ELD Asset Management) Jason Harrison, Senior Vice President at ELD Asset Management at ELD Asset Management, frames the prospective structure as \"a capital-efficient route to compound capability without paying for noise\", adding that \"partial investor recovery often signals price discipline aligned with product execution rather than optics.\" ELD Asset Management stresses that it plays no role in the negotiations and is providing independent analysis and reporting for clients. Prompt AI focuses on object and activity recognition for smart cameras, with pipelines designed to favour local processing. That architecture aligns with Apple's privacy posture by reducing cloud dependency and supporting encrypted storage. Harrison notes \"privacy-by-design at the edge curtails data risk while enabling event-level triggers that developers can productize within HomeKit Secure Video,\" a shift that encourages applications calibrated to specific people, pets and parcels rather than generic motion alerts. Strategically, the likely emphasis is on developer tooling and rapid integration over headline consideration. Harrison highlights \"clear milestones for investors to watch, including framework updates, third-party uptake, and the reliability of context-aware notifications.\" Early-stage financing totals USD 5 million in seed commitments in 2023, and the core proposition remains consistent with Apple's record of compact acquisitions to strengthen applied AI. For portfolio readers, the analytical lens is risk management, pricing discipline and delivery cadence. ELD Asset Management expects the combination of on-device models and granular event detection to expand addressable use cases across security, energy management and assisted living, with regulatory clarity on home-video analytics shaping commercial adoption.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) flipped from solid early gains to a 0.5% loss, even as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and other AI-related stocks floated higher after chip manufacturing giant TSMC's stellar earnings. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) decreased 0.6%, or roughly 300 points. Investors flocked to bonds with the 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) dropping below 4%. Meanwhile, gold ( GC=F ) climbed above $4,300 per ounce, another record for the precious metal. A choppy market action remains the theme of the week on Wall Street, despite hints of coming Fed rate cuts and strong quarterly results from Wall Street banks . Regional banks, however, were in Thursday's spotlight, with shares of Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ) and Western Alliance ( WAL ) plunging after both disclosing problems with loans, adding to concerns over credit stress. Chip stocks rose earlier in the session on Thursday after TSMC ( TSM ) hiked its outlook for 2025 revenue growth for the second time this year, giving hope that surging AI demand will keep on booming. The go-to contract chipmaker for Nvidia and Apple ( AAPL ) also reported a nearly 40% surge in quarterly profit in the last quarter, beating estimates and reaching a record. Nvidia, Broadcom ( AVGO ), Micron ( MU ), and other AI-related stocks rose. Meanwhile, US-China trade frictions were again in the spotlight after Trump confirmed on Wednesday that tensions with China remain elevated. He told a reporter who asked whether the two countries are headed for a long-lasting trade war, \"Well, you're in one now.\" At the same time, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the trade truce between the two could be extended. Another headwind, the US government shutdown , entered its third week.

Regional bank stocks fell after Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ) disclosed that it would take a $50 million loss in the third quarter on two separate commercial and industrial loans. Western Alliance ( WAL ) shares also plunged after the regional lender said a borrower failed “to provide collateral loans in first position.” Meanwhile, Jefferies ( JEF ) stock also moved lower, extending the recent fallout from its involvement in the collapse of First Brands.

Last Friday, it plunged from $121,000 as low as $104,000 following President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. Bitcoin's descent was particularly notable against the backdrop of gold ( GC=F ), which has climbed to new all-time highs past $4,200 and is up 16% in the past month. Bitcoin, by comparison, has yet to recover from Friday's losses and is down 8% in that period. \"Right now, capital is clearly favoring gold due to its momentum and reduced volatility profile,\" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. \"There are also structural buyers in central banks, which provides a quasi-backstop to the trade.\" Read more here.

Most Read from Bloomberg Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors Los Angeles County Declares State of Emergency Over ICE Raids There’s a Better Way to Win on Traffic Safety Trump Floats San Francisco as Next Target for Crime Crackdown NY Senator Behind Casino Push Urges Swift Awarding of Licenses The company is readying a revamped MacBook Pro with a touch display for late 2026 or early 2027, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The new machines, code-named K114 and K116, will also have thinner and lighter frames and run the M6 line of chips. In making the move, Apple is following the rest of the computing industry, which embraced touch-screen laptops more than a decade ago. The company has taken years to formulate its approach to the market, aiming to improve on current designs. Bloomberg News first reported in January 2023 that Apple was working on a touch-screen MacBook Pro. The new laptops will feature displays with OLED technology — short for organic light-emitting diode — the same standard used in iPhones and iPad Pros, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the products haven’t been announced. It will mark the first time that this higher-end, thinner system is used in a Mac. A spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment. Apple shares pared their losses Thursday after Bloomberg reported on the plans. The stock was down 1.2% to $246.32 as of 2:49 p.m. in New York. The touch-screen MacBook Pro will retain a full trackpad and keyboard — mirroring the approach of PC makers like Dell Technologies Inc., Acer Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Microsoft Corp. That means users won’t have to rely on the touch display if they don’t want to. For the revamped MacBook Pro, Apple is retiring the “notch” — the cutout at the top of the screen that houses the camera. In its place, the company will adopt a so-called hole-punch design that leaves a display area around the sensor. This will be similar in concept to the Dynamic Island on the iPhone. The company has also developed a reinforced hinge and screen hardware to prevent the display from bouncing back or moving when touched, a common drawback of existing touch PCs. Because of the pricier components, the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are likely to cost a few hundred dollars more than current versions. Today’s non-touch models with high-end chips start at $1,999 for the 14-inch version and $2,499 for the larger one. Story Continues The current MacBook Pro design dates back to 2021, though Apple refreshed the 14-inch base version with an M5 chip on Wednesday. The company is planning M5 Pro and M5 Max iterations for early 2026 that retain the current look, Bloomberg News has reported. As of now, Apple isn’t actively developing additional touch-screen Macs. Instead, it’s waiting to see the market’s reaction to the touch version of the MacBook Pro, the people said. This follows a typical strategy for Apple, which offers new features on its top-end devices before bringing them down-market. For years, Apple resisted the idea of touch-screen Macs, arguing that PCs with the feature were difficult to use and not ergonomic. It instead pushed users who want touch interfaces to buy iPads. The late Jobs, then Apple’s chief executive officer, said in 2010 that “touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical,” suggesting that they wouldn’t make sense for a computer screen. His successor, Tim Cook, quipped that combining a tablet and a laptop would be like melding a toaster and a fridge. Apple tried a compromise in 2016 with the Touch Bar, a touch-screen strip that sat above the keyboard. This interface replaced the function row, giving access to different controls depending on the task. The feature flopped and was removed in recent years. There have been concerns within Apple that touch-screen computers would cannibalize sales of iPads. But tablet growth has already slowed in recent years, and touch screens have increasingly become must-have features for PCs. And Apple has bridged the gap between iPads and Macs in other ways: The devices now have unified interfaces, processors and app ecosystems. Apple’s iPad Magic Keyboard, introduced in 2020, also showed that customers were interested in combining a touch display with a traditional keyboard and trackpad. The accessory has become central to the iPad Pro’s sales pitch, letting users easily shift between touch and traditional controls. The Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 Touch laptop.Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Adding a touch screen to the MacBook Pro could push users upmarket, creating new revenue opportunities for Apple. While the $999 MacBook Air remains the company’s best-selling laptop, a high-end touch-enabled MacBook Pro might entice customers to trade up — or switch from a Windows PC. Other new Macs in development include updated MacBook Airs with the M5 chip. Those devices — code-named J813 and J815 — are slated for release in the spring. The company is also working on a refreshed Mac Studio, Mac mini, and a pair of external Mac monitors dubbed J427 and J527. Apple is exploring another major Mac change as well: a shift from the Touch ID fingerprint scanner to Face ID. But that remains years away. (Updates with Apple shares in seventh paragraph.)

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries. spectralDSP Corporation Revokes Unauthorized Access to Quantum-Optimized Waveform Enhancements Used in Global 4K/8K Delivery, SoC Modulation, and Bandwidth Scaling PR Newswire October 16, 2025 3 min read In this article: AAPL BOSTON , Oct. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- spectralDSP Corporation today confirms the global revocation of unauthorized access to proprietary waveform enhancements, including Hyper-Scale Channel Integration - Quantum Polymorphic Entropy Super Scaling -heuristic [HSCI-QPESS-h] and Quantum Polymorphic Cryptographic Signaling [QPCS], across 4K/8K video streaming, mobile modems, and next-generation System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architectures. This enforcement follows widespread detection of unlicensed usage, notably across newly launched Apple devices (iPhone 17, A19/Pro, and H3/C1x/N1/N2 silicon SoCs), unauthorized graphic processing unit (GPU) clusters (Memphis H100/H200), and edge-faking content delivery networks (CDNs). spectralDSP spectralDSP's Enforcement Division stated, \"For years, global tech giants benefited from the silent uplift of our quantum-optimized systems. But technology this transformative must never be parasitized. As the stewards of real spectral progress, we withdraw what was never granted—because true ownership demands accountability.\" Technology at the Core The optimizations in question derive from spectralDSP's patented waveform architecture (US11563617B2, US11876661B2, US12301399B2), which provides: Up to 92% reduction in power consumption per 4K/8K video stream Compression-free entropy-optimized video rendering Near-zero latency (sub 15ms) for multi-hop 8K/HDR-10/120Hz video transmission Channel expansion from 1 to 1 billion plus super positioned channels per port True quantum-parameter modulation: 0.08 dB peak to average power (PAPR) + 0.0000ms latency collapse These capabilities are not achievable without spectralDSP's technology stack and have been covertly exploited by unauthorized entities. Legal Justification spectralDSP's action is grounded in U.S. federal and international law: 18 U.S. Code § 1832 — Theft of Trade Secrets 35 U.S. Code § 271 — Patent Infringement 18 U.S. Code § 1030(a)(5) — Felony-grade Network Tampering (if bypass attempted) DMCA § 1201 — Anti-circumvention of proprietary technology Lanham Act — False attribution of optimization source Entities benefiting from this unauthorized performance never held a license, never sought one, and have continued integration despite public notice and filed claims. Therefore, spectralDSP is under no obligation to maintain optimization for such parties, nor to allow misuse of waveform behavior that materially boosts profits under false ownership. Scope of Enforcement Effective immediately, all benefits of spectralDSP's waveform optimization—including quantum mesh benefits, entropy-assisted throughput, and ultra-high-efficiency broadcast—are revoked from the following: Story continues Apple devices using unlicensed A19, A19 Pro, H3, N1, N2, C1x SoCs Apple hardware and software deployed from Spring 2022 to Present GPU clusters (H100/H200) engaged in unauthorized recompile of waveform benefits 4K/8K video CDN delivery networks relying on edge mimicry or Autonomous System Number (ASN)-level obfuscation No damage is caused to these devices and platforms. These platforms are simply returned to their baseline engineering state, which does not include legally protected performance. Exhibit 1: Cumulative Global Enforcement of Apple and NVIDIA SoCs (as of 10/13/2025) by spectralDSP Corp.

      "text": "Just 1 of the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Trading Lower This Year Should Bounce Back By Rick Munarriz – Oct 16, 2025 at 12:36PM Key Points Amazon and Apple are trading lower in 2025, bucking the trend of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which is up 19% overall this year. Amazon has posted unimpressive growth in recent years, despite continuing to operate a thriving, high-margin cloud-hosting business. Its bottom line is making stronger moves. Apple has struggled to get back to its historic growth levels. Its new fiscal year should be its fifth consecutive year of failing to generate double-digit sales growth. NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Market Cap $2.4T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Not every market titan is on top of the world right now. It's been a strong year for some of the largest tech stocks, but not every bellwether is ringing the bell. Some of the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks have been short on the magnificence. Amazon ( AMZN +1.43% ) and Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) are trading lower in 2025 through Wednesday's close. They're not down by much. Amazon is trading 1.7% lower, and Apple is off by a mere 0.4%. However, with the overall Magnificent Seven collection of stocks surging 18.7% in that time, the difference is substantial. Have they lost their way, or can they get back on track? Let's take a closer look at Amazon and Apple as this year's Magnificent Seven stragglers. Expand NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Today's Change ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Key Data Points Market Cap $2391B Day's Range $ 221.91 - $ 225.40 52wk Range $ 161.38 - $ 242.52 Volume 1.6M Avg Vol 44M Gross Margin 49.61 % Dividend Yield N/A 1. Amazon Amazon may have just completed its Prime Big Day Deals shopping event earlier this month, but the e-commerce pioneer itself isn't exactly in its prime right now. Net sales have clocked in between 9% and 12% for three consecutive years. Most retailers would love to be growing at the pace, but we're talking about Amazon. Growth expectations are high for a company that has never delivered top-line jumps of less than 9% in its first 28 years on the market. Total net sales are up 11% through the first half of this year, so it doesn't seem as if a breakout is happening in 2025. Amazon's latest quarter showed signs of life. Net sales rose 13%, its biggest year-over-year increase since the holiday quarter of 2023. Its international sales jumped 16%, even if that was partly enhanced by the falling dollar. Its Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) cloud business soared 18%. AWS represents just 18% of Amazon's business right now, but it's a high-margin juggernaut that should help diversify from the highs and lows of e-commerce. Image source: Getty Images. With its high-margin workhorse once again growing faster than the business that most people know Amazon for, it's not a surprise that profitability is growing faster than net sales. Net income soared 33%, a chunky double-digit percentage that beat analyst expectations. Shares are trading for less than 30 times next year's profit target. It's not cheap, but it's also not expensive if Amazon is starting to turn the corner. Wall Street pros are only modeling a 10% increase in net sales and a 15% move higher on the bottom line next year. It's a familiar pace for Amazon investors in recent years, but we saw how analysts underestimated the company in its previous quarter. Amazon is holding up better than its negative year-to-date returns. If it's able to come through with another quarterly beat in two weeks, it should be able to join the rest of its Magnificent Seven peers in positive territory -- if it doesn't get above that chin-up bar before then. Expand NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Today's Change ( 1.25 %) $ 3.25 Current Price $ 262.83 Key Data Points Market Cap $3900B Day's Range $ 259.20 - $ 264.13 52wk Range $ 169.21 - $ 265.29 Volume 1.9M Avg Vol 55M Gross Margin 46.68 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % 2. Apple Apple began the year as the country's most valuable company by market cap, hitting an all-time high on the final trading week of 2024. These days, Apple has to settle for the bronze, lapped by both Nvidia and Microsoft earlier this year. It's not a race, but there isn't a lot of pep to Apple's step these days. The class act of Cupertino had treated its shareholders to a steady growth cadence, fueled by its revolutionary iPhone. Sales would spike when its flagship phone had an evolutionary upgrade every three years, only to meander in the single digits in the other two fiscal years. This played out for several cycles, but see if you can spot a problematic disruption to the trend lately. Apple's fiscal year ends in September. Here's how its net sales played out over the past few fiscal years since Steve Jobs left us in 2011. 2012: 45% 2013: 9% 2014: 7% 2015: 28% 2016: (8%) 2017: 6% 2018: 16% 2019: (2%) 2020: 6% 2021: 33% 2022: 8% 2023: (3%) 2024: 2% 2025: 6% (through the first three fiscal quarters) Analysts see Apple clocking in with 7% year-over-year quarterly revenue growth when it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on Oct. 30. This will stretch its streak of single-digit positive or negative growth to 15 quarters. Perhaps even more troublesome, it will another year without double-digit growth on the top line. Investing in Apple isn't easy. The market is bracing for net sales to rise just shy of 6% for the fiscal 2026 year that kicked off earlier this month. This would translate into a five-year drought of double-digit jumps for Apple, after consistently delivering no more than back-to-back years of single-digit percentage moves. Apple was supposed to wean investors off the cyclical ups and downs of head-turning iPhone releases. This was going to be a services-driven company, fueled by its expanding audience. The material growth just hasn't been there. Making matters worse, the goal of achieving bottom-line jumps on high-margin services revenue has also fallen short. Earnings from continuing operations over the trailing 12 months is flat with where it was three years ago. Apple needs a hit, and it didn't get there with its big-ticket Vision Pro headset. Its promise to inject artificial intelligence (AI) into its phones hasn't delivered or impressed the market. With Apple trading for more than 30 times forward earnings estimates, it's not as if today's buyers can say that they're bargain hunting. Amazon is the better play for investors among the Magnificent Seven laggards right now.

Yahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman October 16, 2025 In this video: MSFT GOOG AAPL TECHnalysis Research, LLC president Bob O'Donnell sits down with Market Catalysts host Julie Hyman to expand upon the big question weighing over Big Tech right now: are all of these investments into AI worth it and will this lead to profit? To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A It seems like that is the overarching question behind all of this AI back and forth. Is it too much investment? Is how is it all going to play out? Is what is the end market for all of this stuff? 00:09 Speaker B Yeah, it look it's lot of stuff. It's a great question, Julia. I mean, the bottom line is we're really at the very, very early stages of this and that's part of the challenge. But what we saw, you know, what Microsoft announced today in terms of bringing AI into all of Windows 11, not just the co-pilot plus PCs. uh with Apple integrating a little bit more AI compute with the M5, uh I'll talk about that in a second. Um all of these things are moving us towards a day when we can start to interact with all of our devices, with our PCs, uh with our other our phones and other things in a more natural human way. Some of those things are going to be subtle, right? So they're not going to have that whizbang capo sort of thing, but other things are really going to be very practical. Now, in the case of the new Apple stuff, to me the M5 is interesting 00:57 Speaker B honestly more from a technical perspective and as a silicon guy, you know, watching the strategy of, oh, they're bringing M5 now, they're bringing in their modem uh into the iPads. That's kind of interesting from, you know, from an industry analyst perspective, from a semiconductor perspective. I'm not sure it's going to drive a ton of people. You know, it's a nice refresh like if you're about to buy an iPad, you know, for the holidays, okay, great, now I can get the new one. you know, and so you're going to have those kinds of things. Um, you know, in the case of Microsoft, I mean, the nice thing that they're doing is something I think they frankly should have done before, which is bring more AI into all Windows 11 devices. And that's what they're doing here now is, you know, they they're leveraging the cloud. They're not doing all of this stuff on the device. They're leveraging the cloud, but they're enabling things like the ability for Windows to see what you're doing. So when you ask a question about something on your screen, it can actually help you out. 01:43 Speaker B That kind of stuff is practical. 01:45 Speaker A Okay, so it's cool. Is it enough to drive an upgrade cycle? 01:48 Speaker B It's not going to drive a major upgrade cycle beyond I think the typical cycles that we've seen. Um, I think we're going to see, you know, we're continuing to see interest overall in AI PCs, but at a more modest pace, frankly than a lot of people initially expected, uh, because part of the problem is was all this focus without getting into too much detail, but on this notion of an NPU, this dedicated piece of the chip that was going to do AI acceleration. And in truth, it's taken a long time for software developers to create applications that leverage that NPU. And instead, of course, we've seen all this massive investment in doing things in the cloud. And so people get confused because they're like, well, if I'm running open AI on my PC, does that mean I'm doing, you know, AI on the device? Well, not really, but nobody really cares at the end of the day, it's about what what can be done, right? And so, you know, we're starting to see things done. And then in the enterprise, you know, we are starting to hear stories, right? There's companies who are deploying this stuff. I was just at a Dell event the last couple of days. I had a chance to talk with Michael Dell and some of his other leadership and, you know, they're deploying this technology, you know, sort of drinking their own champagne as they say. And they see, for example, they have a chat tool for their sales people. And they can directly see people who are using that tool are performing better than the employees who aren't. So, that's a real classic example of things that are happening. There's plenty of other of those types of examples. 03:00 Speaker B The big question that you were hinting at earlier, I think is, yeah, but does that justify a trillion dollars in open AI, right? That's look, let's be honest. That's a multi-year play. The market doesn't always have the patience for a multi-year play. But I will say this, um, their developer day last week was really interesting to me because what what Sam showed during that keynote was uh this idea, I think a lot of people hadn't thought about. They were integrating applications into Jat into chat GPT. They were uh integrating agents. They were integrating commerce, this deal they did with Walmart. And so all of a sudden you're thinking, wow, they're actually almost creating an operating system, right? And if they're able to to do this, it completely wipes out the traditional way of how we've thought about doing computing and everything happens through chat GPT. Now, look, 03:47 Speaker B that's a long stretch. But I think that's they're thinking big picture in terms of all of this stuff. 03:52 Speaker A Great. How do they make enough money from it to justify the spend? 03:56 Speaker B Well, they would have to be able to get people to buy into that big vision and they would change the nature of the economics of for example, applications would all become agents and they would live within there. 04:08 Speaker A And the other thing is, Bob, like, why do I need that? It's all That is and even the Dell example that you give, like it's all a push, it's not a pull. This is what I keep saying about this whole thing. They're telling me all this stuff I need. Yeah. Like and yes, I get that yes, lots of people are signing up for Chat GBT and saying it's helping them blah, blah, blah. But like it's more of a push than it is a pull this point. and even the Dell example that you just gave, oh, the sales people are, are those the sales people that would be better anyway? 04:34 Speaker B Look, that's a fair question. Um, but, you know, companies are starting to think differently about how they deploy these tools and frankly, thinking about, you know, what kind of people are they're going to continue to employ, right? The other challenge we're seeing is some companies are saying, hey, we're leveraging this technology and in the process we're able to achieve more with less people. And that ultimately, because you're look, it's a great point, but that ultimately is the thought is that we're going to see some kind of ROI where we can be more productive with less. But, you know, as we we all know, look, the money's in the picks and shovels these days, right? All the guys making money in the AI area are all the ones selling the picks and shovels. But unless the gold miners actually find the gold, you know, at some point you stop buying picks and shovels, right? And that is of course the big question mark. But, you know, can these things start to be monetized? That's the big question. What are the mechanisms by which, you know, how does commerce like I said get into there? Walmart saw a huge burst, even though I doubt the amount of sales they're making through Jack GBT is very high, but it's the vision that people are buying into right now. 05:37 Speaker B And again, as I said earlier, how willing is the market? How you know, patient are they to stick up, stick around to see that vision being fulfilled because it's, it's got to deliver something that makes your life better, right? I've got to be more effective at work. I've got to be able to get more things done. If I'm a large-scale organization, "

Here’s what you need to know Sam Boughedda October 16, 2025 1 min read In this article: AAPL Investing.com -- Apple is reportedly preparing to enter the robotics market, a move that Morgan Stanley says could mark “one small step on your desk. One giant leap for AI.” According to Bloomberg, Apple is expanding its smart home manufacturing in Vietnam with BYD handling assembly, testing, and packaging for new products, including a HomePod-style smart display and a motorized tabletop robot. The devices are expected to launch in 2026 and 2027, though they would “likely still face U.S. import tariffs despite the production shift,” Morgan Stanley said. “Apple reportedly is making robots. Let that sink in. Apple – the world’s 3rd most valuable company – is making robots,” Morgan Stanley wrote. The firm added that a company with Apple’s “resources and pedigree can have a deterministic impact on the world of robotics.” Morgan Stanley called the development “another ‘moment’ in the journey of AI getting physical,” noting that “as AI moves from the digital world (bits & bites) to the physical world (atoms and photons), investors can expect to see unprecedented examples of tech firms moving into the industrial world.” The firm also highlighted what it called the “Race for Photons,” saying, “You could have all the compute in the world – but you can’t train a Vision Language Action model without vision data.” Turning to the competitive landscape, Morgan Stanley said that “Elon Musk may have been early on identifying the opportunity of physical AI and robotics,” but that “the secret is out,” with Apple now joining the “Mag 7 names” targeting the field.

Yang’s departure marks the latest in a string of exits from Apple’s AI unit, putting the company into jeopardy in the lead-up to a much-anticipated Siri revamp scheduled for March. Ruoming Pang, Apple’s former head of AI models, left for Meta earlier this year . Roughly a dozen team members on Apple’s AIML (AI and machine learning) team also left the company. Several members joined Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs . A few weeks ago, Yang began overseeing the Answers, Knowledge, and Information (AKI) team, which is tasked with improving Siri’s functionality by allowing it to pull information from the web so Apple can better compete with rivals in the AI search market, like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. The new Siri also promises to be able to tap into personal data for more complex tasks.

By AP with Doloresz Katanich Published on 16/10/2025 - 16:35 GMT+2 Share this article Comments Share this article Facebook Twitter Flipboard Send Reddit Linkedin Messenger Telegram VK Bluesky Threads Whatsapp Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer, reported an unexpected jump in its net profit for the July-September quarter. Beating analysts’ forecasts, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC said on Thursday that its net profit surged by 39.1% in the last quarter, boosted by a surge in AI use. The company reported a record net profit of 452.3 billion new Taiwan dollars (€12.64bn) in the July-September quarter, higher than analysts' forecasts. The company earlier said its revenue jumped 30% year-on-year in the last quarter. “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies,” said Wendell Huang, senior VP and chief financial officer of TSMC. The semiconductor firm has been building chip fabrication plants in the United States and Japan to help hedge against risks from China-US trade tensions. The chipmaker is a major supplier to companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Related OpenAI’s Stargate locks in Korean chipmakers, boosting shares Netherlands invokes rare emergency law to take charge of Chinese chipmaker \"Demand for TSMC's products is unyielding,\" Morningstar analysts wrote in a note this month. \"Given TSMC's dominance, we doubt the company would be hindered if it faced tariffs on shipments to US customers. We expect AI demand to stay resilient.\" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick proposed last month that computer chip production be divided 50-50 between Taiwan and the US. Taiwan, where the majority of global chip manufacturing is currently based, rejected that idea. The company has committed $100bn (€86bn) in US investments, including building new factories in Arizona, on top of $65bn (€55.8bn) that it pledged earlier. “Moving into fourth quarter 2025, we expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies,\" Huang said. Based on the company’s current business outlook, they expect revenue to be at least €27.62bn (between $32.2bn and $33.4bn), in the fourth quarter of 2025. In 2024, fourth-quarter revenue came in at around €24.3bn.

      "text": "Is Apple's Growth Story Over? Here's What History Says. By Prosper Junior Bakiny – Oct 16, 2025 at 10:00AM Key Points Apple's tariff-related (and other) challenges are not exactly new. The company has managed to deal with these in the past. The tech giant looks in a good position to do the same this time around. NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Market Cap $3.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.25 %) $ 3.25 Current Price $ 262.83 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Don't count this tech juggernaut out too fast. Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) has undeniably provided life-changing returns to its long-term shareholders. The company's innovative streak and powerful brand have been key factors behind its performance. But is the party over for the tech giant? Apple has encountered some headwinds this year, particularly tied to tariffs and President Trump's trade wars. The stock has suffered, and considering it's worth $3.5 trillion, some see little upside ahead for the iPhone maker. However, looking at some precedents, as well as Apple's own business, can help paint a clearer picture. Image source: Getty Images. Apple has survived these troubles before Whether it's due to the potential impact of tariffs or slowing iPhone growth, Apple has seen and overcome obstacles of this kind before. During Donald Trump's first presidency, the threat of tariffs was also present, though perhaps not as much as it is now. On Jan. 3, 2019, Apple's stock dropped by about 10% after the company lowered its guidance because of weak iPhone sales volume in China, partly resulting from Trump's trade wars. And On Aug. 5, 2019, Apple's shares fell by 5% after Trump announced tariffs on Chinese-imported goods. In both cases, Apple was able to rebound with flying colors. The stock has beaten the market following these two significant one-day market losses. Apple was, at the time, able to get around tariffs somewhat by negotiating with the administration to avoid -- or at least delay -- punitive duties on its imports. Regarding the slowdown in iPhone sales in China, the company adopted a multipronged strategy that included slightly cutting prices. The result: Apple managed these roadblocks just fine, its financial results remained strong, and it crushed the market, as per its habit, in the years that followed. The future is in the subscription business The usual caveats regarding applying the past to the future are worth keeping in mind, especially since there are some important differences here. Trump's tariffs are even more aggressive this time around, for instance. And investors are also worried that the tech leader is falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, one of the most important points to highlight about how Apple has navigated struggles before is that the company is highly adaptable. It announced local manufacturing efforts, amounting to $600 billion over the next four years, in a move to get back on Trump's good side. Expand NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Today's Change ( 1.25 %) $ 3.25 Current Price $ 262.83 Key Data Points Market Cap $3900B Day's Range $ 259.20 - $ 264.13 52wk Range $ 169.21 - $ 265.29 Volume 1.9M Avg Vol 55M Gross Margin 46.68 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Elsewhere, the company is looking to boost AI investments and attract talent in the field. Apple is close to acquiring PromptAI, an AI startup whose flagship app enhances home security cameras through smart activity detection features. PromptAI features notable names in the field, including its founder, Tete Xiao, who holds a Ph.D. in the field and has published academically. Even if this acquisition falls through, Apple has generated $96.2 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period and has the means to buy out more AI talent. The company generally doesn't rush to launch new products or features. Apple's strength has been its ability to add innovative tweaks to existing technologies and win over consumers, something it has done several times with smashing success. And with a vast and growing installed base of over two billion active devices, the company needs just a few successes to make a meaningful impact on its financial results. Furthermore, Apple's future is in its service segment. The company has more than a billion paid subscriptions. Launching new services, whether related to AI or not, should allow the company to increase this predictable, high-margin source of recurring revenue. Over the long run, this will decrease Apple's exposure to tariffs and even hardware sales. What should remain is a massive installed base that serves as the basis for subscriptions across a wide range of everyday activities for its customers, from news and TV to health and payments. The opportunities here are massive, making Apple's prospects attractive despite the headwinds it has encountered. History tells us the company can overcome them. The moves Apple is making today suggest there is a good chance it will overcome them.

The company posted a record quarterly profit and raised its annual revenue expectation, pointing to robust demand from customers including AI chip giant Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Apple ( AAPL ). Earlier this week, major deals were announced in the AI sector. A $40 billion acquisition of data-center operator Aligned by a BlackRock-led group, which followed a pact between OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) to build 10 gigawatts of custom chips, enough to power more than 8 million U.S. households. The developments show that Wall Street's \"picks and shovels\" trade around AI hardware remains strong nearly three years after ChatGPT's debut, as Big Tech and startups race to build systems that can match or surpass human intelligence. \"This isn't just a transient spike. TSMC's blowout quarter tells a clear story ... this is no longer a cyclical story, it's structural,\" said AvaTrade's chief market analyst Kate Leaman. Shares of memory chipmaker Micron Technology ( MU ) jumped about 4%, extending a strong 2025 rally as demand for high-bandwidth memory used in AI servers stays tight. Its rival Samsung Electronics closed 2.8% on the South Korean bourse. Nvidia rose 1.2%, whereas Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) gained 1.3% and Broadcom climbed 2.4%. On Wednesday, Salesforce projected revenue exceeding $60 billion by 2030, driven by rapid AI integration across its cloud services, reflecting broader enterprise investment trends that support sustained demand for advanced semiconductors.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) flipped from solid early gains to a 0.5% loss, even as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and other AI-related stocks floated higher after chip manufacturing giant TSMC's stellar earnings. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) decreased 0.6%, or roughly 300 points. Investors flocked to bonds with the 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) dropping below 4%. Meanwhile, gold ( GC=F ) climbed above $4,300 per ounce, another record for the precious metal. A choppy market action remains the theme of the week on Wall Street, despite hints of coming Fed rate cuts and strong quarterly results from Wall Street banks . Regional banks, however, were in Thursday's spotlight, with shares of Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ) and Western Alliance ( WAL ) plunging after both disclosing problems with loans, adding to concerns over credit stress. Chip stocks rose earlier in the session on Thursday after TSMC ( TSM ) hiked its outlook for 2025 revenue growth for the second time this year, giving hope that surging AI demand will keep on booming. The go-to contract chipmaker for Nvidia and Apple ( AAPL ) also reported a nearly 40% surge in quarterly profit in the last quarter, beating estimates and reaching a record. Nvidia, Broadcom ( AVGO ), Micron ( MU ), and other AI-related stocks rose. Meanwhile, US-China trade frictions were again in the spotlight after Trump confirmed on Wednesday that tensions with China remain elevated. He told a reporter who asked whether the two countries are headed for a long-lasting trade war, \"Well, you're in one now.\" At the same time, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the trade truce between the two could be extended. Another headwind, the US government shutdown , entered its third week. The stoppage, which has deprived the Fed and Wall Street of key data on the economy, is increasingly expected to continue into November .

Regional bank stocks fell after Zions Bancorporation ( ZION ) disclosed that it would take a $50 million loss in the third quarter on two separate commercial and industrial loans. Western Alliance ( WAL ) shares also plunged after the regional lender said a borrower failed “to provide collateral loans in first position.” Meanwhile, Jefferies ( JEF ) stock also moved lower, extending the recent fallout from its involvement in the collapse of First Brands.

The world's largest cryptocurrency surged to start the month as investors sought a hedge against US government shutdown uncertainty. Last Friday, it plunged from $121,000 as low as $104,000 following President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. Bitcoin's descent was particularly notable against the backdrop of gold ( GC=F ), which has climbed to new all-time highs past $4,200 and is up 16% in the past month. Bitcoin, by comparison, has yet to recover from Friday's losses and is down 8% in that period. \"Right now, capital is clearly favoring gold due to its momentum and reduced volatility profile,\" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. \"There are also structural buyers in central banks, which provides a quasi-backstop to the trade.\" Read more here.

      "text": "Microsoft's latest Windows 11 update puts AI at the center of your PC Daniel Howley · Technology Editor October 16, 2025 4 min read In this article: MSFT AAPL OPAI.PVT Microsoft ( MSFT ) is more tightly integrating AI into its Windows 11 operating system with a series of updates aimed at making the technology more accessible for its massive user base. The upgrades, the company said, are aimed at making every Windows 11 PC an AI PC, enabling you to voice chat with Microsoft's Windows Copilot and allowing the bot to see your screen when you want it to and take actions at your request. And the company is framing it all around an ad campaign with the slogan \"Meet the computer you can talk to.\" Microsoft is positioning its voice chat option, called Copilot Voice, as the biggest change coming to Windows. Microsoft is framing the update around the ad campaign's slogan: 'Meet the computer you can talk to.' · Microsoft \"We believe this shift to conversational input will be as transformative as the mouse and keyboard in terms of unlocking new capabilities on the PC for the broadest set of people,” Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi said in a statement. With the update, you'll be able to say, \"Hey, Copilot,\" followed by your request. The company is pairing this with its Copilot Vision feature, which allows the bot to analyze onscreen content to give you more information about what you're viewing. All of this, Microsoft said, requires your permission. When combined, Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision appear to make for a powerful duo. In one ad for the update, Microsoft illustrates how you'll be able to ask Copilot what kind of microphone a streamer is using in their video. Copilot will then look at the mic and be able to tell you the exact model type and where you can buy it. Another ad shows an architect with her portfolio open on a screen, asking Copilot to help write her biography for her webpage. The bot then quickly views her work and begins providing a spoken biography based on it. A screen showing the option to enable Copilot Actions. (Image: Microsoft) · Microsoft The software is also designed to help you get more out of apps. A third ad shows a user asking Copilot how to improve the audio quality of music in Spotify. Copilot then highlights the option for streaming quality and tells her to change the setting to \"lossless\" audio. In another example, Microsoft shows its Copilot Actions functionality. Available in preview for now, Copilot Actions acts as a general-purpose agent for manipulating files saved on your computer. For instance, you can ask Copilot to reorient a large group of photos and delete duplicates, and it'll do just that. Microsoft said Copilot performs these tasks in a secure environment, telling you what it's doing at each step and allowing you to stop it or take over manually. Copilot Actions will be off by default. Story Continues If you're not comfortable talking directly to your computer because you're, say, in an office or coffee shop where doing so is untenable and kind of weird, you can also type your request into Copilot, and it will respond in text rather than out loud. The company is also bringing Copilot to its Xbox services, allowing gamers to get in-game tips while they're playing. All of this comes as Microsoft looks to further capitalize on its vast investments in artificial intelligence while establishing itself as a leader in the consumer AI space. The company's work with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) has been a boon for its enterprise and cloud businesses, and now it's seeking to reap the same rewards on the PC side. So far, Microsoft is well ahead of Apple ( AAPL ), which is still working on its long-delayed AI-powered Siri. And while the iPhone maker is also infusing its various operating systems with AI services, it's still nowhere near what Microsoft has with Copilot. That said, it remains to be seen how many consumers will shop for new Windows PCs solely because they have interesting AI features, and not because they're simply newer, faster systems by virtue of the fact that they came out more recently than the five-year-old laptop they have at home. Microsoft has also officially ended support for Windows 10, which could help boost Windows 11 sales in the coming months.

      "text": "Microsoft's latest Windows 11 update puts AI at the center of your PC Daniel Howley · Technology Editor October 16, 2025 4 min read In this article: MSFT AAPL OPAI.PVT Microsoft ( MSFT ) is more tightly integrating AI into its Windows 11 operating system with a series of updates aimed at making the technology more accessible for its massive user base. The upgrades, the company said, are aimed at making every Windows 11 PC an AI PC, enabling you to voice chat with Microsoft's Windows Copilot and allowing the bot to see your screen when you want it to and take actions at your request. And the company is framing it all around an ad campaign with the slogan \"Meet the computer you can talk to.\" Microsoft is positioning its voice chat option, called Copilot Voice, as the biggest change coming to Windows. Microsoft is framing the update around the ad campaign's slogan: 'Meet the computer you can talk to.' · Microsoft \"We believe this shift to conversational input will be as transformative as the mouse and keyboard in terms of unlocking new capabilities on the PC for the broadest set of people,” Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi said in a statement. With the update, you'll be able to say, \"Hey, Copilot,\" followed by your request. The company is pairing this with its Copilot Vision feature, which allows the bot to analyze onscreen content to give you more information about what you're viewing. All of this, Microsoft said, requires your permission. When combined, Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision appear to make for a powerful duo. In one ad for the update, Microsoft illustrates how you'll be able to ask Copilot what kind of microphone a streamer is using in their video. Copilot will then look at the mic and be able to tell you the exact model type and where you can buy it. Another ad shows an architect with her portfolio open on a screen, asking Copilot to help write her biography for her webpage. The bot then quickly views her work and begins providing a spoken biography based on it. A screen showing the option to enable Copilot Actions. (Image: Microsoft) · Microsoft The software is also designed to help you get more out of apps. A third ad shows a user asking Copilot how to improve the audio quality of music in Spotify. Copilot then highlights the option for streaming quality and tells her to change the setting to \"lossless\" audio. In another example, Microsoft shows its Copilot Actions functionality. Available in preview for now, Copilot Actions acts as a general-purpose agent for manipulating files saved on your computer. For instance, you can ask Copilot to reorient a large group of photos and delete duplicates, and it'll do just that. Microsoft said Copilot performs these tasks in a secure environment, telling you what it's doing at each step and allowing you to stop it or take over manually. Copilot Actions will be off by default. Story Continues If you're not comfortable talking directly to your computer because you're, say, in an office or coffee shop where doing so is untenable and kind of weird, you can also type your request into Copilot, and it will respond in text rather than out loud. The company is also bringing Copilot to its Xbox services, allowing gamers to get in-game tips while they're playing. All of this comes as Microsoft looks to further capitalize on its vast investments in artificial intelligence while establishing itself as a leader in the consumer AI space. The company's work with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) has been a boon for its enterprise and cloud businesses, and now it's seeking to reap the same rewards on the PC side. So far, Microsoft is well ahead of Apple ( AAPL ), which is still working on its long-delayed AI-powered Siri. And while the iPhone maker is also infusing its various operating systems with AI services, it's still nowhere near what Microsoft has with Copilot. That said, it remains to be seen how many consumers will shop for new Windows PCs solely because they have interesting AI features, and not because they're simply newer, faster systems by virtue of the fact that they came out more recently than the five-year-old laptop they have at home. Microsoft has also officially ended support for Windows 10, which could help boost Windows 11 sales in the coming months.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the top trending stock ratings and calls. Edison Lee, Jefferies analyst, said in a latest program on CNBC that Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) much-awaited foldable phone would not be enough for the company to “move the needle.” The analyst recently downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to sell and said the market’s expectations about an upgrade cycle are too high. “The smartphone industry—not just Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), but also the Android players—is facing a serious structural slowdown because there are no truly innovative features that current phones can’t already perform. Most improvements are incremental. The foldable next year is exciting for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), but it is not a brand-new form factor; it has been around for several years. Looking at Samsung’s latest foldable, the Galaxy F7, which is priced at $2,000, it’s a very nice phone, but volumes are unlikely to exceed 3 million units. The iPhone could potentially sell three times that due to its high-end, loyal customer base, but even so, it probably won’t be enough to significantly move the needle.” Photo by Sable Flow on Unsplash Early indicators point to a strong consumer response to the latest iPhone 17. However, can this enthusiasm lift the stock in the long term, especially when the company is falling behind in the AI race? Apple can only do so much in innovation to revolutionize its iPhone each year. A UBS survey shows that the iPhone upgrade cycle has reached 35 months in the US. A separate report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says about 63% of iPhone users keep their smartphones for more than two years. Apple is losing its pricing edge as it has to put a cap on its price tags to compete in key markets like China. Samsung, Xiaomi and other companies can launch advanced hardware and software features to compete with Apple and keep the company under pressure in Asia. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Finally, shares of technology bellwether Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed the market and lost value as the company faced a classic innovator’s dilemma, which appeared all the more egregious as competitors embraced the AI opportunity. Apple has had a dominant market position in smartphones and services, but now more than ever, investors are questioning the future outlook for the company. Despite posting a negative absolute strategy return during the quarter, which weighed on absolute strategy returns, relative to Apple’s the company’s large position in the benchmark our underweight position proved to be a tailwind to relative results during the quarter.” Story Continues While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The survey comes amid lower expectations that the central bank will cut interest rates again in 2025. In the BoE's latest quarterly credit conditions survey, published Thursday, bank and building society lenders reported that demand for secured lending for house purchases was unchanged in the third quarter. Lenders also expect demand for this type of borrowing to be unchanged in the fourth quarter. However, lenders did report an uptick in demand for secured lending for remortgaging in the third quarter. They expect demand for this type of borrowing to increase in the final three months of the year. Read more: How does inflation affect interest rates? The findings come as the BoE is forecast to keep interest rates on hold for the rest of the year, as inflation remains sticky, coming in at 3.8% in August . The BoE opted to keep its bank rate at 4% at its September meeting, with its next decision due on the 6 November. The central bank has kept interest rates elevated in an effort to get inflation under control, though it is also trying to balance that with avoiding too much of a slowdown in the economy. Data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the UK economy grew by just 0.1% in August, though this was in line with expectations and marked a slight improvement over July, when the country's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.1%. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that \"with inflation still high and rising, we doubt the soft GDP news will tempt the Bank of England to cut interest rates again this year\". The BoE's interest rate influences those set by lenders, which can mean stronger returns on savings accounts, but also higher rates of interest on borrowing products, such as mortgages. Mortgage rates have started to edge back up , according to data from Moneyfacts this week, with average deals rising month-on-month for the first time since February. Read more: Detached home owners making average £122,500 profit when selling This comes on top of existing concerns about affordability weighing on demand in the housing market. The latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) pointed to continued weakness in house buyer demand. The research flagged concerns about the impact of uncertainty over the upcoming autumn budget in November and the prospect of further property-related taxes being announced. Story Continues In addition to the findings on demand for mortgage lending, the BoE's quarterly credit conditions survey on Thursday also looked at the outlook for loan pricing. In the survey, lenders reported that the length of interest-free periods on credit cards for balance transfers and for purchases both increased in the third quarter. Lenders also expect the length of interest-free periods on both products to increase in the fourth quarter, in the runup to Christmas. At the same time, the BoE said its survey showed that defaults on credit cards are expected to increase in the final three months of the year.

Chipmakers ( NVDA , TSM , AMD , AVGO , ASML ) are in the green as the world's demand for computing power keeps growing. Chinese electric car maker NIO sees shares spiral in connection with a lawsuit. And today's speculative stocks to watch include Critical Metals ( CRML ), Bitdeer ( BTDR ) and Microvast ( MVST ). For more live coverage of markets watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and head to Yahoo Finance . Video Transcript 00:04 Speaker A It's time now for today's trending tickers from enterprise software to chips to speculative plays. Let's dive in. First up, Salesforce is seeing a strong rally in pre-market. Up more than 6% right now. Shares of the software maker were up more than 5% after it announced a $7 billion dollar uh share buyback and a revenue target of more than $60 billion by 2030. 00:27 Speaker A Now, Salesforce is giving investors a glimmer of hope here ahead of its next earnings report on December 1st. And after a difficult 2025 where stock is down about 30% this year. 00:39 Speaker A Now, unlike Salesforce and other AI software stocks, hardware and chip stocks only seem to keep growing. Alongside TSMC, the world's largest chip manufacturer that reported a record profit of nearly $15 billion for Q3. You can see here that ASML, AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom are all set to open in the green as the world just can't get enough chips to meet AI computing needs. 01:01 Speaker A Broadcom just struck an infrastructure deal deal with Open AI that's propping up the stock this morning. 01:07 Speaker A Turning to electric vehicles now. Neo, the Chinese giant that's been rising so far this year is hitting a major setback. Shares are down nearly 8% in pre-market today after losing sorry, nearly 7% in pre-market today after losing 13% in Hong Kong. The big takeaway here is that despite strong delivery growth and improved margins, Neo is exposed to political tensions combined with a lawsuit in Singapore that is eroding trust in the company. 01:31 Speaker A Finally, I want to put on your radar three speculative stocks that are seeing wild swings. 01:38 Speaker A Still in the space of electric vehicles, Microvast is a battery maker listed on the Nasdaq, and its stock is shooting up again in the pre-market. Almost 6% higher, and this after it closed at plus 19%. 01:49 Speaker A Look at this. It's up nearly two over 2,800% in one year. That's not a typo. That's not a typo. This looks like a bit of a meme stock. It's popular on Reddit, and it seems to be driven by rising tensions between US and China over rare earths. 02:02 Speaker A Another stock that's seeing wild swings right now, also on US-China tensions is critical minerals. After an incredible ride this week, CRML fell 25% yesterd yesterday, but guess what? It's up again, more than 7% in pre-market. 02:16 Speaker A Finally, I want to mention Bitdeer. It was a massive winner yesterday, posting gains as high as 30% at one point. Now, up a little bit, just shy of 7/10 of 1%, as you can see there. Now, the company is riding the wave of artificial intelligence plus crypto tech. 02:37 Speaker A And staying on AI, but on a very different company. Apple announced a new more powerful chip for its devices. My colleagues Dan Howley and Julie Hyman discussed what it means for the Cupertino giant and for our personal tech.

The business executives are part of an advisory board for Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management that typically gathers every year and Cook is the chair of that committee. He, also the country’s vice premier, reiterated China is willing to deepen ties with all nations and said he hoped the board members will actively support the country’s economic development, state-media Xinhua News Agency reported, citing their meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. Meetings with top Chinese leaders are rarely confirmed until the last minute, while the Xinhua report didn’t identify the executives who got an audience with He. The planned meeting was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. The sitdown would come at a fraught time in bilateral ties as the US has called for a response with other nations to China’s curbs on rare earths announced last week. The new rules would require Chinese approval for products containing even trace amounts of certain minerals. Beijing has justified its moves as defensive actions after the US introduced new restrictive measures targeting China after trade talks in Madrid in September. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday at a CNBC forum in Washington that President Donald Trump is still expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month in South Korea. Bessent also said there’s a “very good chance” that he would travel to Asia before Trump to meet He. Last year, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang met the Tsinghua advisory board representatives and welcomed their suggestions on China’s economy. The board was founded in 2000 to bring together business executives, administrators and scholars to discuss economic issues and the management school’s development. Cook, who chaired the advisory board last year, pledged on Wednesday in Beijing to boost investment in China during a meeting with Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Lecheng. Cook also outlined a donation to Tsinghua University, the country’s most prestigious college and Xi’s alma mater. Story Continues --With assistance from Mark Gurman and Foster Wong.

Before AI was single-handedly keeping the economy from recession, the backbone of the world’s finances was the FAANG companies, including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. All of these companies shared a focus on personalisation, using data to tailor their offerings to every customer. Artificial intelligence has quickly become embedded in the machinery of modern banking, but for many institutions, its application has been conservative, confined largely to operational efficiency, fraud detection, and customer support automation.

Find out more These are important, but they leave much of AI’s potential untapped. If banks restrict its use to cost control, they risk missing what may prove to be its most transformative role: a direct driver of new revenue streams. For me, efficiency is only the first step. The real opportunity lies in deploying AI to power hyper-personalisation, predictive analytics, and dynamic pricing. Capabilities that can reshape how banks generate growth. With more than two decades of experience in global payments, working with issuers, acquirers, and enterprises worldwide, I have seen first-hand how data-driven technologies are beginning to redefine the competitive landscape. Data is the new oil At the core of this shift is the monetisation of data. Banks sit on vast repositories of transactional insights that extend beyond individual customers to wider behavioural patterns. Historically, this data has been underused, in part because of the complexity of regulation and in part due to a lack of tools to extract actionable intelligence. Think of this like being able to pump thousands of barrels of crude oil but not being able to refine it. AI changes that. By analysing transaction flows, spending categories, and cashflow patterns in real time, banks can identify opportunities to deepen relationships with customers. A customer consistently paying for overseas streaming services, for instance, may be more receptive to tailored foreign exchange offers. GlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate? Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence A small business whose payments spike seasonally could benefit from dynamic credit terms. These are commercially viable applications of AI that move banks from passive service providers to proactive partners in growth. Of course, the question is not only how much data can be harnessed but how responsibly it can be deployed. This is where compliance and innovation intersect. I would point to the growing role of self-hosted AI frameworks as a way forward. Instead of sending data to external models, which risks violating GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, or PSD2 rules across the EU, banks can build and train models internally. That approach keeps sensitive data within the bank’s perimeter while still allowing experimentation and innovation. The advantage is twofold: it protects customer trust while enabling banks to develop proprietary AI capabilities that become a source of competitive differentiation. Equally critical is transparency. As regulators tighten scrutiny of automated decision-making, “black box” AI poses a reputational and compliance risk. Explainable AI – models that can articulate the rationale behind their outputs – is emerging as a cornerstone of responsible innovation. For customers, this ensures clarity when decisions affect their creditworthiness or pricing. For regulators, it provides assurance that automated processes are auditable and fair. Banks that succeed in embedding explainability into their systems are more likely to win both customer trust and regulatory goodwill, creating a stable foundation for growth. Cultural change before technological Some leading banks are already moving in this direction. JPMorgan Chase has invested heavily in AI not just to reduce costs but to identify new opportunities in trading and wealth management. Goldman Sachs has integrated machine learning into its consumer platform Marcus, leveraging data to refine offers and pricing strategies. These examples illustrate that AI, when placed at the centre of revenue generation strategies, can reshape competitive positioning. The institutions that treat AI purely as a back-office utility will struggle to match the agility of those that put it to work on the front line of customer engagement. For most banks, the challenge is cultural as much as technological. AI adoption at scale demands a mindset shift, away from defensive compliance-driven deployment and toward a more entrepreneurial approach that balances risk with innovation. This does not mean abandoning caution; it means recognising that the responsible use of AI can generate entirely new forms of value. It also requires investment in talent. Data scientists, ethicists, and compliance specialists must work together to design systems that are not only commercially effective but socially and legally robust. There is also the question of timing. As competition intensifies, first movers gain the advantage of shaping customer expectations. If one bank begins offering predictive, personalised services that adapt in real time, others will be forced to follow. The longer institutions wait to explore AI as a revenue enabler, the harder it will be to catch up once customer baselines have shifted. My perspective reflects my vantage point, where issuing and acquiring services across multiple geographies provide daily exposure to how payments and data are converging. From that position, I see the growing evidence that AI’s future in banking will not be decided solely in the back office. It will be determined in how effectively institutions can turn data into trusted, transparent, and compliant sources of growth.

Disclosures from former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) CEO Warren Buffett are among the most-watched filings throughout the year for analysts, investors and retail traders. While it may be surprising, there are currently four stocks that are owned by Berkshire Hathaway and in the stock portfolio of Nancy Pelosi, which is managed by her husband Paul Pelosi. The 4 Shared Stocks The Benzinga Government Trades page for Nancy Pelosi shows four stocks disclosed by the congresswoman in the last five years that have not been sold and are also owned by Buffett's conglomerate. Trending: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.81 a Share Here are the four stocks owned by both Nancy Pelosi and Warren Buffett: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ): Berkshire Hathaway owns an even 10 million shares, currently valued at $2.16 billion, according to CNBC . Pelosi disclosed buying 40 call options with a strike price of $150 and expiration date of Jan. 16, 2026. The purchase made on Jan. 14, 2025 was valued at $250,000 to $500,000. Visa Inc (NYSE: V ): Berkshire Hathaway owns 8,297,460 shares of Visa, valued at $2.89 billion. The stake is currently worth around 1% of the conglomerate's investment portfolio. Pelosi has been an owner of Visa stock for many years with her husband buying shares when the company went public in 2008. Pelosi also disclosed multiple purchases of the stock after the company went public. In recent years, Pelosi has sold portions of the position with chunks of 20,000 shares and 10,000 shares sold in 2022 and 2,000 shares sold in 2024. Filings show that Pelosi likely owns more Visa shares even after the recent sales. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ): The technology giant is currently the largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway investment portfolio. The conglomerate owns 280 million shares worth over $69 billion. The holding represents around 23.1% of the investment portfolio and gives Berkshire around 1.9% ownership of the iPhone maker. Berkshire Hathaway has been selling portions of its Apple stake in recent quarters. Pelosi also owns Apple stock with multiple purchases of call options in recent years and portions of the stake donated to colleges and universities with ties to the congresswoman and her husband. The most recent Apple transaction disclosed by Pelosi was the sale of 31,600 shares on Dec. 31, 2024. Story Continues American Express (NYSE: AXP ): Buffett has been a long-time believer in American Express, first buying shares in the 1960s and later making Berkshire's big bet in the 1990s. The conglomerate currently owns 151,610,700 shares of American Express, valued at more than $50 billion. The position represents around 16.8% of the Berkshire Hathaway investment portfolio and gives the company around 21.8% ownership of American Express. See Also: Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property Different Investing Styles Pelosi’s husband has a history of buying call options that are in the money and have expiration dates of a year from the purchase date. He later exercised the options into common stock. Investments are often made in the technology sector, favoring large-cap names. While Paul Pelosi favors the technology sector and high-growth names, Buffett has been a bigger believer in value stocks and out-of-favor companies. Buffett also tends to invest in companies for the long term by buying common shares and not options. Pelosi and Buffett's overlap covers two main sectors in technology (Amazon, Apple) and finance (Visa, American Express). Apple and American Express are the two largest holdings in Berkshire's investment portfolio, currently, indicating that two of the most closely watched names in finance share some investment beliefs. The duo could both be betting on Apple's future growth thanks to its large customer base and revolving lineup of smartphones and tech products that have become must-owns for many. For American Express, the two investors likely see a financial juggernaut with a long history of success that could have future growth as it expands into new areas of the sector.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry. Arrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly. Vinovest Vinovest lets investors diversify into fine wine — a historically stable, low-volatility asset class that has outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple decades . With professionally managed portfolios, secure storage, and insurance included, users can invest in wine without needing to be experts themselves. Minimums start at $1,000, and investors retain full ownership of their wine, which has the potential to appreciate in value as global demand grows. Worthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income. IRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies. Moomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash.

      "text": "Have $500? 2 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now By Will Healy – Oct 16, 2025 at 5:45AM Key Points Roku is moving closer to sustainable profitability. Doubts about AI have not slowed Amazon's profit growth. NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Market Cap $2.4T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET These stocks' low valuations may come as a surprise to investors. One great thing about stock market investing is that there are always opportunities to drive returns. This includes \"cheap stocks,\" even today, when the indexes routinely reach new record highs. Moreover, many of these stocks support desired brands, and though they face some challenges, investors could earn market-beating returns by adding shares now. Hence, if one has $500, it might pay to take positions in the following two stocks. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Roku Admittedly, being \"cheap\" may not be enough to persuade some investors to consider Roku ( ROKU 2.16% ) . It has fallen more than 80% from its 2021 high amid its struggles despite the secular trend that is moving TV viewing to streaming platforms. Expand NASDAQ : ROKU Roku Today's Change ( -2.16 %) $ -2.12 Current Price $ 96.16 Key Data Points Market Cap $14B Day's Range $ 96.11 - $ 100.25 52wk Range $ 52.43 - $ 107.25 Volume 92K Avg Vol 3.5M Gross Margin 44.04 % Dividend Yield N/A Roku competes with the likes of Alphabet ( GOOGL +2.73% ) ( GOOG +2.67% ) and Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) , which have weighed on the stock's recovery efforts. Indeed, Roku holds a higher share of the market than the tech giants competing with it. However, Roku is in a much weaker financial position. Although it has achieved positive free cash flow in every quarter since the third quarter of 2023, it has typically reported net losses since 2022. In comparison, the cash positions of Alphabet and Apple each exceed Roku's $14 billion market cap , placing it at a severe disadvantage. Fortunately for Roku, it is more heavily focused on the TV OS market. That has allowed Roku to maintain its No. 1 position in the market in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Moreover, in the second quarter of 2025, streaming hours increased by 17%. Such increases should ultimately boost the advertising sales that drive most of the platform's revenue. Additionally, Roku turned profitable in Q2 for the first time in three years. While the profit came from unrealized gains in its investments, the company is on track to return to operational profitability by next year. The fact that its stock is up by more than 25% so far this year suggests that investors have turned more optimistic. Also, Roku does not yet have a P/E ratio because of its losses. Still, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.1 is just below the 3.3 average for the S&P 500 . Amid such conditions, Roku and its stock are arguably best positioned to capitalize as the transition from traditional TV to streaming continues. Since a part of a $500 investing budget could buy three shares for $283 at recent prices, investors could be off to a great start as Roku works to return to all-time highs. 2. Amazon With the $217 left, investors may be in a position to buy one share of consumer tech giant Amazon ( AMZN +1.43% ) . Despite a market cap exceeding $2.3 trillion, its growth days are far from over. Indeed, its online sales business is a slower-growth business, and it is not clear from the company's financials that it turns a profit. Nonetheless, that business gives Amazon tremendous exposure and market power within retailing. It is also the cornerstone of its subscription, third-party seller, and digital advertising businesses, all of which report double-digit revenue on a yearly basis. Another major part of the company is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the application that helped it start the lucrative cloud computing industry. This business segment has long driven the majority of Amazon's operating income, though investors have soured on it as a perceived lack of clarity in AI has caused some investor doubts. That has left Amazon with a flat stock performance for the year. Additionally, its five-year performance returns have been relatively modest amid the more recent struggles and the tech-related sell-off in 2022. Expand NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Today's Change ( 1.43 %) $ 3.16 Current Price $ 224.25 Key Data Points Market Cap $2391B Day's Range $ 221.91 - $ 225.40 52wk Range $ 161.38 - $ 242.52 Volume 1.6M Avg Vol 44M Gross Margin 49.61 % Dividend Yield N/A However, that challenge may be more perception than reality. In the first half of 2025, Amazon's net income of $35 billion increased by 48% compared to the same period one year ago. Hence, its financials continue to make significant improvements. Finally, its P/E ratio has fallen to 33. Despite that being above the S&P 500 average of 30, that earnings multiple is attractive considering that Amazon's P/E ratio was usually more than 50 and routinely above 100 in recent years. Considering the lower valuation and the rising profits, investors should benefit from adding Amazon shares in the near term.

ASML, ASM International, BE Semiconductor were all higher by 04:14 ET (08:14 GMT). In the United States, TSMC suppliers Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research rose in premarket trading. AI-darling Nvidia, meanwhile, edged up by 1.1% before the opening bell, while rival Advanced Micro Devices added 0.9%. TSMC, whose clients include Nvidia as well as iPhone-maker Apple, reported a 39.1% jump in net profit to T$452.30 billion ($14.75 billion) for the three months to September 30. The figure was higher than a Reuters/LSEG estimate of T$417.7 billion. Markets were primed for a strong reading, after TSMC disclosed a 30% spike in its quarterly revenue last week. Revenue rose to T$989.92 billion ($32.30 billion), while gross margin stood at 59.5%. The world’s biggest manufacturer of cutting-edge AI chips also predicted that euphoria around AI would gather even more pace, projecting a jump in current-quarter revenue by as much as 24%. It also reiterated its forecast for capital spending of up to $42 billion this year, despite potential headwinds from sweeping U.S. tariffs and currency fluctuations. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei struck a largely positive tone on expectations of AI-fuelled demand, and dismissed concerns over potential sales headwinds from the U.S. blocking chip sales to Chinese markets. \"We continue to observe robust AI-related demand throughout 2025… The explosive growth in token volume demonstrated increasing consumer AI model adoption, meaning more computation is needed,\" Wei said in a post-earnings call, noting that this was likely to underpin demand for semiconductors. \"I have confidence in my customers,\" Wei said when responding to an an analyst question regarding potential Chinese headwinds. \"If the China market is not available, I still think the AI growth will be very positive,\" Wei said, adding that he remained confident a compound annual growth rate of 40% or higher could be maintained even if Chinese markets were blocked out Related articles Some European, U.S. chip stocks gain after TSMC posts third-quarter income spike 17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4 Natural Gas: Consolidation Could Set Stage for Breakout Above $3.20 Barrier View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Brent crude ( BZ=F ) futures rose 0.8% to trade at $62.41 per barrel at the time of writing, while West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ) futures gained 1% to $58.89 a barrel. Both benchmarks closed Tuesday at a five-month low. The uptick came despite the lack of a confirmed timeline from New Delhi, and no official announcement has been made by the Indian government. India’s foreign ministry responded by reaffirming its commitment to energy security and price stability, noting it would continue to diversify its sourcing. Alongside China, India has been a major buyer of discounted Russian oil ( BZ=F , CL=F ), taking advantage of the G7 price cap mechanism aimed at limiting Moscow’s revenues while maintaining global supply. The US is reportedly trying to get China to also stop buying oil from Moscow, in an attempt to pressure the Kremlin to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine. Read more: Stocks slip as UK economy grows just 0.1% and trade deficit widens Washington has grown increasingly vocal about India's continued purchases of Russian oil, with senior US officials accusing Indian companies of profiting from the war-linked discount. The issue remains a key point of friction in ongoing US-India trade negotiations. India’s trade secretary said on Wednesday the country has capacity to increase oil imports from the US by up to $15bn. “This is bullish news for sure,” Mukesh Sahdev, CEO of energy consultancy Xanalysts in Sydney, told Bloomberg . “India’s Russian oil imports have been roughly three times those from the US, so replacing those volumes would likely require ramping up purchases from the Middle East.” Gold ( GC=F ) Gold prices surged to an all-time high in early European trading, extending their rally into a fifth straight session, amid trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, a US federal government shutdown and the prospect of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, gold ( GC=F ) futures had gained 1%, to $4,245.60 per ounce, while the spot price had climbed 0.8% to $4,234.41 per troy ounce, a record high. \"The commentary from the Fed that emphasised higher prospects of rate cuts going forward is supportive, while US president Donald Trump turning around and labelling this a trade war is clearly providing a pretty strong impetus for gold ( GC=F ),\" said OANDA senior analyst Kyle Rodda. Story Continues Trump declared the US was locked in a trade war with China, fuelling fears of sustained economic disruption, adding to the appeal of gold ( GC=F ). Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, however, signalled a more dovish tone, suggesting a pause in new tariffs on Chinese goods to defuse tensions over critical minerals.

At the same time, a looming US federal government shutdown and the broader prospect of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve have reinforced investor demand for gold ( GC=F ). Analysts at ANZ Group Holdings, including Soni Kumari and Daniel Hynes, described gold’s ( GC=F ) rise as an “extraordinary rally,” with no immediate signs of slowing. They raised its year-end forecast to $4,400 per ounce, with a peak near $4,600 expected by June 2026. Pound ( GBPUSD=X , GBPEUR=X ) The pound rose modestly on Thursday, supported by broad-based dollar weakness as escalating US-China trade tensions and growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut unsettled investor sentiment. Sterling was 0.2% higher against the greenback at $1.3420 and up 0.1% against the euro at €1.1515. Sterling gained against the dollar after a dispute between Washington and Beijing over critical supply chains intensified. It also secured some gains after data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK economy grew 0.1% in August . \"Relative to its G10 peers, the pound ( GBPUSD=X , GBPEUR=X ) has managed a fairly unremarkable performance in recent weeks. Like all other G10 currencies, it has lost ground vs. the USD and, while it is also trended lower vs. the EUR in recent weeks,\" said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank.

TSMC, the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and  Nvidia Corp., now foresees mid-30% growth in annual sales, up about a few percentage points from previously. The outlook hike was striking given Taiwan’s biggest company last raised its guidance just three months ago, igniting a rally that’s tacked on more than $260 billion to its market value. Most Read from Bloomberg Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors Los Angeles County Declares State of Emergency Over ICE Raids HUD Issues Layoff Notices, Targeting Fair Housing Staff With Deep Cuts With Roles as Civic Hubs, Libraries Turn Over a New Page There’s a Better Way to Win on Traffic Safety The results underscore how TSMC remains one of the bigger beneficiaries of a spending spree on AI infrastructure that’s expected to cross the $1 trillion mark in coming years. From OpenAI to Oracle Corp., industry leaders are racing to build the data centers that underpin the technology in the post-ChatGPT era. TSMC’s higher projection followed a better-than-anticipated 39% jump in net income to NT$452.3 billion ($14.8 billion) in the September quarter. On Thursday, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei reiterated his industry was grappling with geopolitical uncertainty, and acknowledged how US sanctions have begun to close off swathes of China, the world’s largest semiconductor arena. Businesses across the global semiconductor supply chain are bracing for disruptions after Beijing imposed curbs on rare-earth mineral exports — essential to most technology devices — and the US responded with additional tariffs and restrictions on software sales to the Asian nation. But Wei argued that AI demand would make up for that lost market. “Conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening,” he told analysts after outlining earnings. “The AI demand actually continues to be very strong, stronger than we thought three months ago.” Click here for a blog from the earnings briefing. As the world’s most advanced manufacturer of semiconductors, TSMC plays a dominant role in an AI investment frenzy with Nvidia at its heart. The US company makes the powerful accelerators vital to the training and operation of AI services like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Yet that investment rush, coupled with a rapid climb in tech stock valuations, has drawn comparisons to the dotcom bubble given the persistent absence of mainstream AI applications and services. TSMC is in constant touch with customers to try and map out future demand and plan for capacity expansion, Wei said. Story Continues “Obviously there’s some question marks about the China situation, from a number of different angles,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Bloxham said. “But they seem very optimistic that even without China, there’s very robust demand for their platforms.” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Matthew Bloxham breaks down the numbers.Source: Bloomberg On Thursday, TSMC raised the lower end of its capital spending target for the year. Taiwan’s largest company is now earmarking at least $40 billion for capacity expansion and upgrades in 2025, up from a floor of $38 billion previously. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says TSMC’s raised full-year sales growth target to mid-30% confirms growth momentum for AI chips is unabated and suggests there’s more room for the company to raise its 2- to 3-nm nodes price in 2026. Given TSMC’s dominance in leading-edge processing nodes and 2.5D packaging, we believe this price increase can be in the 5-10% range. - Charles Shum, analyst Click here for the research. Much of that will go towards building capacity. The company is constructing in the US in part to alleviate trade risks.

NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Market Cap $3.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.25 %) $ 3.24 Current Price $ 262.82 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET Microsoft's Copilot is already helping generate billions in revenue, while Apple is in the midst of enhancing its iPhones with new AI features. Microsoft ( MSFT +0.59% ) and Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) are forever rivals. They are competitors in the personal computer market and for years have been the leading tech companies in the world. Even today, their valuations are similar. As of Tuesday's close, Microsoft had a slight edge in market cap ($3.82 trillion versus $3.67 trillion). There's a new arena that could be their new battleground: artificial intelligence (AI). It's still the early innings of AI deployment, and how their businesses evolve and adapt to AI remains a big question mark. But based on where they are today, which AI stock looks to be the better buy right now? Image source: Getty Images. Which company has the better overall growth prospects? Both of these companies already have large, robust businesses that can benefit from AI. Apple is a big name in consumer electronics with its iPads and iPhones being highly coveted products and, in some cases, status symbols. Microsoft, meanwhile, has its core in the business world with companies all over using its office products and cloud software for their day-to-day operational needs. They also both sell personal computers, with Microsoft focusing more on practicality and real-world business use, while Apple's focus has been on simplicity and ease of use for the average user. They both have many opportunities where AI can enhance their existing products in services. But the edge for sheer growth potential has to go Microsoft, simply because of how much broader its business has become over the years, especially in gaming, with it wrapping up its massive $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard a couple of years ago. Expand NASDAQ : MSFT Microsoft Today's Change ( 0.59 %) $ 3.05 Current Price $ 523.61 Key Data Points Market Cap $3892B Day's Range $ 520.71 - $ 525.35 52wk Range $ 344.79 - $ 555.45 Volume 16M Avg Vol 20M Gross Margin 68.82 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % Which company will benefit the most from AI? AI has tremendous potential applications for these businesses. Many Apple users have been eagerly awaiting the launch of new AI-powered features for the company's iPhones and were disappointed when they learned many of the key ones related to Siri will be pushed back until next year. When that happens, however, that could trigger a flurry of upgrades and growth for the business. I don't think a slow-and-steady approach will necessarily hurt Apple. In fact, it could end up being a smart move for the tech company by taking its time and ensuring everything is rolled out smoothly, to ensure that user privacy is well protected in the process. Microsoft has already been enhancing its products and services with AI capabilities. However, there's been plenty of debate about just how successful its Copilot AI really is. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has referred to it as \"Clippy 2.0,\" in reference to the frustrating assistant that Microsoft had years ago that users didn't find all that helpful. Apple deserves an edge when it comes to AI potential, simply for the massive wave of upgrades that could be coming if it hits it out of the park with its new iPhone features. Expand NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Today's Change ( 1.25 %) $ 3.24 Current Price $ 262.82 Key Data Points Market Cap $3900B Day's Range $ 259.18 - $ 264.13 52wk Range $ 169.21 - $ 265.29 Volume 38M Avg Vol 55M Gross Margin 46.68 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Which stock has the more attractive valuation? It's always important to consider valuation when buying a stock, as buying at a high price may impact your ability to earn a good return from your investment in the future. For a while, Microsoft's stock was trading at more of a premium to Apple's stock, but in recent weeks, that gap has evaporated. Data by YCharts. This one is easy to decide: It's a tie. Their price-to-earnings multiples are almost identical at this stage. But it is notable to see that prior to the announcement of reciprocal tariffs in April, it was Apple that was trading at more of a premium than Microsoft, and then the trend reversed, with Apple's exposure to manufacturing its iPhones in China likely weighing down the stock for part of the year. Which stock should you buy? The stock I'd buy today is Apple. It has devoted fans who will be willing to upgrade to the newest iPhone, even under challenging economic conditions , if it means access to cutting-edge features. Apple may be slow in rolling out AI, but when it does, the execution can be a lot cleaner, polished, and better for users in the end than if it were rushed. Microsoft, meanwhile, has been quick to rush out AI features for its software. However, in an increasingly crowded market for AI services, it may have a more difficult time keeping customers happy when there may be other, and potentially better, options to choose from. Apple, may, in the end, benefit from being a bit slower in its AI deployment.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the trending stocks. Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones recently warned that “ingredients” are in place for a massive stock rally before a potential downturn amid rising speculative behavior in the markets. The billionaire said investors should position themselves to take advantage of the bull run. “Feels exactly like 1999. I don’t know whether we’ll actually replay it exactly, but I think all the ingredients are in place and certainly from a trading standpoint, you have to position yourself like it’s October 99.  I don’t see why you would do anything but that. And remember, the NASDAQ doubled between the first week of October 99 and March of 2000. So, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s probably not a chicken.” How is Tudor Jones positioning amid the AI boom? According to the SEC filings as of the end of the second quarter, Tudor Investment owns a $141.9 million stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Finally, shares of technology bellwether Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed the market and lost value as the company faced a classic innovator’s dilemma, which appeared all the more egregious as competitors embraced the AI opportunity. Apple has had a dominant market position in smartphones and services, but now more than ever, investors are questioning the future outlook for the company. Despite posting a negative absolute strategy return during the quarter, which weighed on absolute strategy returns, relative to Apple’s the company’s large position in the benchmark our underweight position proved to be a tailwind to relative results during the quarter.” While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has been a massive beneficiary of the frenzy in AI investment. TSMC's clients Nvidia and Apple are among firms pouring many billions of dollars into chips, servers and data centres, fuelling concerns about a financial bubble. \"AI demand actually continues to be very strong -- stronger than we thought three months ago,\" TSMC chairman and chief executive CC Wei told a briefing. TSMC said net profit for the three months to September soared 39.1 percent from a year ago to NT$452.3 billion (US$14.7 billion), a quarterly record. The figure beat expectations of NT$406.67 billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. Third-quarter revenue was up 30 percent, also higher than forecasts. TSMC's announcement follows a flare-up in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, and concerns about US export restrictions to China and possible tariffs on chips. China's rare earth export curbs and bid to ramp up its own chip industry has also sparked fears about the impact on AI. Even if the Chinese market were not available to TSMC and its customers, Wei said \"AI growth will be very dramatic\" and \"very positive\". AI-related spending is soaring worldwide, and is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion by 2025, according to US research firm Gartner, and over $2 trillion in 2026 -- nearly two percent of global GDP. \"It's not just Apple's new iPhone driving sales. AI clients like Nvidia and AMC are ramping up orders for high-end chips as well,\" Dilin Wu, research strategist at Pepperstone, told AFP ahead of the earnings release. \"It shows TSMC's technology and capacity are still hard to replicate, and that underpins both margins and valuations for the company.\" Looking ahead, Wu said companies \"might pull forward shipments to avoid restrictions, so basically front-running the tariffs.\" That would be \"especially AI chip and GPU clients, certainly in the Chinese market,\" she said. The concentration of production in Taiwan has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an attack by China, which claims it as part of its territory -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it. While TSMC plans to invest an additional US$100 billion in the United States, Washington has been pressuring Taipei to shift more production to US soil. Story continues US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said recently he had proposed to Taiwan a 50-50 split in chip production, which Taipei rejected. burs-amj/kaf View comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. is the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer. It reported a net profit of a record 452.3 billion new Taiwan dollars ($15 billion) in the July-September quarter, higher than analysts’ forecasts. The company earlier said its revenue jumped 30% year-on-year in the last quarter. TSMC has been building chip fabrication plants in the United States and Japan to help hedge against risks from China-U.S. trade tensions. The chipmaker is a major supplier to companies such as Apple and Nvidia . “Demand for TSMC’s products is unyielding,” Morningstar analysts wrote in a note this month. “Given TSMC’s dominance, we doubt the company would be hindered if it faced tariffs on shipments to U.S. customers. We expect AI demand to stay resilient.” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick proposed last month that computer chip production be divided 50-50 between Taiwan and the U.S. Taiwan -- where the majority of global chip manufacturing is currently based -- rejected that idea. The company has committed $100 billion in U.S. investments, including building new factories in Arizona, on top of $65 billion that it pledged earlier.

(Bloomberg) -- Global investors are ramping up bets on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ahead of its earnings, confident that the world’s leading chip foundry will remain one of the biggest winners from the AI spending boom. Most Read from Bloomberg Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors HUD Issues Layoff Notices, Targeting Fair Housing Staff With Deep Cuts Los Angeles County Declares State of Emergency Over ICE Raids With Roles as Civic Hubs, Libraries Turn Over a New Page There’s a Better Way to Win on Traffic Safety Its American depositary receipts are trading at the highest premium to its Taipei shares since 2002, on a 50-day moving average basis. That’s driven by growing awareness among investors around the world of the company’s role as the main outsourced supplier of chips for Nvidia Corp. and many others. The ADRs have surged 54% this year, outpacing the 38% gain in the Taiwan listing, as global traders boost bullish bets. Earnings due after Thursday’s close could be the next catalyst following last week’s better-than-expected sales. “We are positive on TSMC’s outlook and expect it to raise its full-year 2025 sales growth outlook,” said Rex Chen, a Taipei-based fund manager at Capital Investment Trust Corp. TSMC’s ADRs tend to trade at a premium because they’re fungible with Taipei-listed shares — unlike the latter, which require regulatory approval to be converted into US-listed depositories. Still, Chen said that the recent premium shows that international investors are even more optimistic than local investors, which could lead to a re-rating thanks to the AI boom. Strong orders from Apple Inc. for chips to power the most advanced iPhone models as well as foundry service for Nvidia’s Blackwell are expected to fuel TSMC’s revenue in the coming quarters. Investor enthusiasm was boosted this week as TSMC client Broadcom Inc. signed a blockbuster deal with OpenAI. TSMC is likely to “sound quite bullish on data center AI demand” and signal demand for its leading-edge wafers, including those used in Apple products, will remain tight through 2026, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a research note. Meanwhile, ASML Holding NV’s third-quarter results, released Wednesday, show that the AI boom continues to drive demand for its cutting-edge chipmaking machines — a positive sign for its customer TSMC. Options traders are also positioning for more gains. The cost of bullish contracts on the ADRs has climbed to the highest level this year relative to bearish bets, rebounding from a low in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Story Continues The US-China trade war remains a concern, and one focus of TSMC’s earnings call will be how the chipmaker plans to mitigate the potential impact on its supply of materials and tools, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum. He added that strong AI demand will likely offset such headwinds. “I don’t think investors are worried,” said Vey-Sern Ling,  senior equity adviser for Asia technology at Union Bancaire Privee. “China is unlikely to weaponize rare earth restrictions, it’s just a threat to hang over the US.” The stock climbed as much as 1.7% to a fresh record in Taipei on Thursday ahead of the earnings report. It’s looking overheated on some technicals, and its valuation has climbed from a trough three years ago. Still, even as global tech multiples draw scrutiny amid bubble fears, TSMC trades at 27 times forward estimated earnings, cheaper than more than half the stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Capital Investment Trust’s Chen, whose fund holds TSMC as its largest position, thinks the chipmaker’s valuation has room to expand longer term. He expects the company to raise sales growth guidance to 32%-34% from the current 30% for this year. “We are confident about its growth outlook this and next year as applications of AI widen,” Chen said. “The current development of AI is like when Apple launched the iPhone 3 or iPhone 4 — still at an early stage.” --With assistance from Cecile Vannucci.

(AP Photo/John McDonnell) · Associated Press Finance SEUNG MIN KIM October 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: AMZN AAPL BAH COIN CMCSA WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their pledged contributions to a massive new ballroom . The ballroom, whose price tag is now estimated at $250 million, is the most significant renovation that Trump, a former real estate mogul, is undertaking during his second term at the White House . All four sides of the ballroom — which Trump said will be large and grand enough to hold even a presidential inauguration -- will be made of bulletproof glass, with its color, window shape and molding keeping in character with the White House. Trump indicated that the fundraising and managing costs for the “phenomenal” ballroom were going well, predicting that he would have money left over after the project is done. “To me, there’s nothing like the White House,” Trump said, later adding, “It’s just a special place so we have to take care of it.” Men in business suits and women in cocktail attire sat at a dozen round tables, decorated with tall, tapered candles and white floral arrangements, and sipped wine and water as they awaited their dinner to be served on gold-trimmed plates. Later, they would dine on an heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef Wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice cream. Among the companies that had representatives at the dinner, according to a White House official, were Amazon, Apple , Booz Allen Hamilton, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms and T-Mobile. The Adelson Family Foundation, founded by GOP megadonors Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, also had a presence there. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, and crypto entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were all on the guest list. The list of attendees was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Also attending the dinner were Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager from his 2024 reelection bid; Reince Priebus, a White House chief of staff during Trump's first term; and Jason Miller, another longtime political adviser. The new ballroom is planned for the area where the East Wing is located and will encompass 90,000 square feet. The White House has previously said it will have a 650-person capacity, but Trump on Wednesday night said it will be able to hold up to 999 people. The ballroom project has yet to receive approvals from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, although White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who was also tapped by Trump to lead the planning commission, says approval is not needed . The commission vets construction of federal buildings. Story Continues At the dinner, Trump said there are no zoning requirements for him as the president of the United States and he can do whatever he wants with the construction. The president has repeatedly complained that large White House events require construction of a tent on the South Lawn, since the East Room – the current largest space at the White House – can accommodate only about 200 people. At the dinner, Trump also formally unveiled another project: an arch that will stand on one end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River and connects Virginia and the District of Columbia. He showed off several miniature models of the proposed arch — which will feature Lady Liberty on top — in three sizes, although Trump acknowledged that the largest was his favorite. “It’s going to be really beautiful,” Trump said. ___ Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.

Omdia: Mainland China’s Smartphone Market Declined 3% in 3Q25 as Vivo Regained Top Position Amid Intensifying Competition Business Wire October 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: TTGT AAPL 1810.HK Mainland China smartphone market shipment, 1Q22 to 3Q25 Mainland China smartphone shipment market share, top vendors, 1Q24 to 3Q25 Mainland China’s smartphone shipment and annual growth LONDON, October 16, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--According to Omdia’s latest research , mainland China’s smartphone market declined 3% year on year in 3Q25. The market remains in an adjustment phase, while competition among leading vendors has intensified, with shipment gaps between the top players continuing to narrow. vivo regained the top spot with shipments of 11.8 million units, accounting for an 18% market share. Huawei followed closely in second place with 10.5 million units and a 16% share. Apple maintained its strong momentum from the previous quarter, shipping 10.1 million units and moving up two places year on year to rejoin the top three. Xiaomi shipped 10.0 million units, ranking fourth, while OPPO followed with 9.9 million units to round out the top five. \"Although the market has contracted for two consecutive quarters, the narrowing decline indicates that the shipment fluctuations triggered by the government subsidy program at the beginning of the year are coming to an end, with the market gradually returning to normal,\" said Lucas Zhong, Analyst at Omdia . \"A more cautious shipment pace has allowed vendors to maintain healthier inventory levels, paving the way for an active Q4 driven by flagship launches, the Double 11 shopping season, and a potential new round of subsidies. At the same time, vendors are also making longer-term strategic moves. Since the launch of the Pura X earlier this year, Huawei has preinstalled HarmonyOS 5.0 across its major new models. While this transition poses short-term challenges in software optimization and user experience, consistent execution will likely strengthen Huawei’s ecosystem moat, particularly in an increasingly saturated market.\" \"Major vendors refreshed their entry-level and mid-range product lines in Q3.

The big US carrier reported third-quarter profits of $949 million, down 1.7 percent from the year-ago level, as growth in operating expenses edged out the increase in revenues of 2.6 percent to $15.2 billion. The company estimated fourth-quarter profits of between $3.00 and $3.50 per share, better than Wall Street estimates. United is poised for a \"strong\" fourth quarter \"as the demand environment strengthens,\" said a United press release. The outlook echoes bullish commentary about consumer appetite earlier this month from Delta Air Lines. Both carriers have billed themselves as able to provide a premium-travel experience that emphasizes better onboard amenities in addition to reliable operations in an effort to strengthen brand loyalty. United's press release emphasized perks such as Apple TV on board, increased investment on food quality and the introduction of Starlink Wi-Fi on flights, which is scheduled to launch on Thursday in a flight from Newark to Houston. The company promises Starlink on \"every plane by 2027,\" said United CEO Scott Kirby. \"Our customers value the United experience, making them increasingly loyal to United.\" Shares of United fell 1.8 percent in after-hours trading. jmb/sla View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

The company introduced updated versions of its MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Vision Pro on Wednesday, giving customers more power and speed across its product family. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TRUE. Is AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. The new MacBook Pro starts at $1,599, the 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999, and the latest Vision Pro headset, which includes a more comfortable Dual Knit Band and new features with visionOS 26, starts at $3,499. All three are available to preorder now and go on sale globally on Oct. 22. Apple said the new M5 chip offers four times the computing performance of the M4, with a major focus on AI processing. Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said the M5 is built to deliver a huge boost to AI workloads, signaling how central artificial intelligence has become to the company's product strategy. The timing of the release follows Apple's usual fall playbookrolling out new hardware before the critical December quarter, when holiday spending drives its strongest results. This season also marks the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales, launched last month alongside the Apple Watch Series 11. Analysts say Apple's M5 launch could help spark another wave of upgrades, especially as consumers look for faster performance and better AI integration. The company is betting that by bringing more AI power directly into its devices, it can stay ahead in a market increasingly defined by intelligence and speed.

      "text": "Apple adds 650 megawatts of renewables in Europe with more coming in China Tim De Chant October 15, 2025 2 min read In this article: AAPL Mounting the rotor blades on a wind turbine | Image Credits:ZU_09 / Getty Images Apple announced Tuesday that it had signed contracts for 650 megawatts of renewable power in Europe. This includes wind and solar projects that are either operational or will be soon. A large chunk of the power they’ll produce will go toward offsetting the energy used by Apple customers . Use of everything from Mac Pros to Apple Watches accounts for nearly one-third of the company’s carbon footprint. Even though Europe isn’t usually considered a sunny continent, Apple is buying energy from several solar farms, including 110 megawatts each in Greece and Latvia, 131 megawatts in Spain, and 40 megawatts in Poland. Wind farms will contribute 99 megawatts in Romania and a portion of the 129 megawatt solar-wind portfolio in Italy. Separately, Apple also said it would invest $150 million in China to help its suppliers switch to renewable energy. Already, renewable sources power more than 90% of the company’s manufacturing and production in the country. Perhaps most notable about these announcements is that they appear in the newsrooms of Apple’s regional websites, but not in the feed of its U.S. press site. Previously, the company’s press releases on regional renewable power purchases have appeared in that feed, perhaps out of a desire to not draw the ire of the Trump administration, which has been antagonistic to renewables. Still, solar and wind — and increasingly grid-scale batteries — have been the go-to source of energy for tech companies looking to power their operations. Microsoft and Meta have also been consistent buyers of solar in particular. This year alone, Meta has added over 2 gigawatts of solar capacity, and Microsoft has signed deals that raise its total by 1.5 gigawatts. While most big tech firms have pledged to move to renewable power, more practical considerations help drive such deals. Solar and wind are among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, undercutting coal and natural gas. When paired with batteries, which continue to drop in cost, they can provide firm, 24/7 power. The other reason is speed: Solar farms can be built quickly, with a typical project requiring just 18 months to complete. What’s more, they can be completed in phases, allowing part of the project to come online early. For tech companies, which are in a race to secure power for their data centers and AI operations, that speed can make a significant difference.

Oct 15 - Apple's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) latest iPhone 17 release is shaping up to be one of its strongest product cycles in years. Early signs show pre-orders up 5%10% year over year, while global lead times have surged 80%, a signal that demand remains robust across key markets. With more than 315 million iPhones due for upgrades, Apple is tapping into a massive replacement wave. JPMorgan (JPM) forecasts shipments of roughly 236 million units in fiscal 2026, up 2% from last year, helping to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and about $80 billion in iPhone sales. Evercore ISI expects over half of buyers to opt for Pro models, keeping average selling prices near record highs. Is AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Apple's push to diversify production into India is also paying off. The company exported nearly $7.5 billion worth of iPhones in just four months, a shift that reduces dependence on China and cushions risks from renewed U.S.-China tariff tensions. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley ( NYSE:MS ) raised its iPhone build estimates for the September quarter to 54 million units, while Wedbush and Evercore both lifted their price targets to $310 and $290, respectively. Still, Apple faces growing regulatory pressure. The European Commission fined the company 500 million for violating the Digital Markets Act, and similar investigations in the U.K. and South America could add up to $1 billion in annual penalties. Apple and Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) are reportedly negotiating to settle some of these cases. Those head winds notwithstanding analysts are optimistic. As iPhone demand shifts, and services margins remain strong, the FY26 outlook of Apple is indicated by earnings momentum and possible doubling of share price, or AAPL stock.

Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) is tightening its grip on China just as trade tensions threaten to flare again. During a high-profile trip to Beijing this week, CEO Tim Cook met with Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Lecheng and pledged to deepen Apple's investment and supplier cooperation in the country. For Apple, China remains more than just a major sales engineit's the operational heartbeat of the company's global supply chain. Despite growing political pressure from Washington, including threats from President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on overseas-made products, Cook's message was measured but unmistakable: Apple isn't walking away from China anytime soon. Is AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. The visit carried both strategic and symbolic weight. Cook toured an Apple store in Shanghai, met Labubu creator Kasing Lung, and announced a donation to Tsinghua UniversityChina's equivalent of Harvard. The timing was notable, coinciding with the launch of the new iPhone Air series. While Apple has spent recent years spreading its manufacturing footprint to India and Vietnam, the reality is that China remains irreplaceable. Partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. continue to assemble the vast majority of iPhones, underscoring how dependent Apple still is on China's industrial muscle. Yet diversification has proven harder than headlines suggest. Earlier this year, Foxconn sent hundreds of Chinese engineers home from India, a setback for Apple's South Asia expansion push. At the same time, reports surfaced that Beijing had quietly urged regulators to limit tech transfers and equipment exports to India and Southeast Asiaa reminder of how geopolitics can quickly redraw corporate roadmaps. Cook's renewed engagement in Beijing could be a pragmatic acknowledgment of that reality: Apple may continue broadening its global footprint, but for now, the company's balance of powerand productionstill tilts decisively toward China.

President Donald Trump’s latest salvo in the reheated spat between the U.S. and China, delivered during the final minutes of Tuesday’s trading session and focused curiously on cooking oil, snuffed out a solid market rally and dragged all three major indexes into the red by the time the closing bell sounded. Last week’s record-setting rally was also stopped dead in its tracks when the president threatened an additional 100% tariff on China-made goods in retaliation for Beijing’s decision to limit the export of rare-earth elements that are critical to the U.S. tech sector.

Uh, that's a big deal for uh whether you're developing large language models or working with large language models uh on your Mac. Uh, for the iPad, uh it gives it a nice boost in terms of performance at a time when they're starting to make the iPad kind of more Mac-like with the, they launched iOS 26. You can now multitask with it a lot better. Uh, if you want to move your window off to the side slightly, it's not going to automatically boomerang back and kind of, you know, you can move things where you want, right? And so that's something we've wanted for a long time. You got a Pro iPad, why can't I do that? Now you can. Uh the MacBook Pro 15, uh 14, excuse me. That also gets uh the big upgrades as far as graphics and those AI capabilities. Uh Apple's really playing up the uh capabilities that they have when it comes to games. That's been something that they've been pushing heavily, although they're not really a huge player in the space. But really this is kind of the uh evolution of what Apple's been doing since it launched the original M1, moving away from their their Intel chips. They still, by the way, if you look at their uh press release today, talk about how much better it is than having an Intel Mac. Not going to lie, it is much better. You can get much better battery life and performance overall. Uh and so, I think that's going to be a continuing part of the story. The other part uh is we're waiting for the other shoe to drop in this, which is when we see the Pro, the M5 Pro, the M5 Ultra. They usually do that with all their chips. So this is just the the uh the base version. We're going to get even more powerful ones as we kind of progress through the next year and next few months. 02:25 Speaker A Remind us in for Apple, we talk about the Mac and the iPad iPad businesses. How important are they still for Apple, just financially and strategically? 02:35 Dan Howley They're very important for them. Uh, they obviously, you know, from a financial standpoint, they're the two smallest businesses. Now, that's, you know, 20 some odd billion dollars a year. That's not peanuts, but when you look at, you know, 200 billion for the iPhone a year, it's not the same, right? But it's important because it keeps people locked in the ecosystem. Now, you can absolutely have a MacBook and an Android phone, you know, nothing saying that that's illegal. Uh, but if you have an iPhone, chances are you're going to say, well, I want to go for a Mac. If you have a Mac already, you're probably going to get an iPhone. Ditto with the iPad. If you have an iPhone, you're probably going to go to the iPad. When you have that iPad, you use it all the time, you ready for a new phone, you're probably going to say, I want that. 03:15 Speaker A Just easier to stay in the family. 03:17 Dan Howley Exactly, keeping it, keeping it in the family. Uh and you know, I think that that's probably, probably the the biggest uh piece of the Mac iPad uh infrastructure that they have, also services. I mean, services is their second largest business, continues to grow at a rapid clip. The fact that they continue to add Macs and iPads, keep adding new uh software offerings, it's a big deal. I think, you know, the the main thing here is just we're just waiting for that next Siri. Uh you know, the the AI powered Siri, it's still I mean, months away perhaps. We were supposed to see it in June. No such luck, so we have to wait and see. I got to say though, uh as far as Papa John's, it is not pizza. Neither is Domino's, but it is delicious. 04:00 Speaker A Better than Papa John's. Well said, Dan. Fair, a fair assessment as always. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

      "text": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Faces “More Downside Than Upside” as Jefferies Flags Tariff Concerns Ghazal Ahmed October 15, 2025 2 min read In this article: AAPL Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the AI Stocks in Focus on Wall Street . On October 13, Jefferies reiterated the stock as “Underperform” and lowered its price target on the stock to $203.07 per share from $205.16. Analyst Edison Lee noted “more downside than upside” ahead for Apple. “As flagged before, tariffs could come back to haunt AAPL.” The firm highlighted how Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on Chinese goods, which starts Nov. 1, would hit Apple. This is considering the company relies heavily on China for assembly. “Not only could the current tariff-exempt status of smartphones change, the uncertainties around the U.S.-India and U.S.-China tariff framework are underestimated risks. As Trump has just slapped an additional 100% (now 30%) tariff on Chinese imports, whether smartphone import from China would continue to be exempted remains uncertain.” The firm anticipates a 5% EPS hit in FY2026 if the company pays a 130% tariff on an estimated 9 million units. Since Indian production is unable to fully cover U.S. demand, Apple will be vulnerable if tariffs are imposed. Lee pointed out that China is unlikely to meet 100% of its U.S. demand for iPhone 17s with production from India. The company may also face additional pressure from the administration to make more iPhones in the U.S. This especially holds in the event of an escalating U.S.-China conflict. Margins for the company’s latest lineup may be further thinned by an unfavorable product mix and a higher bill of materials cost. “iPhone 17’s sales momentum has shown further slowdown.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

We are watching regional banks, Apple and Abbott. First up, regional banks, Citizens, First Horizon, and PNC all out with earnings. Both Citizens and First Horizon reported earnings per share for the third quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. PNC meanwhile saw its more expensive commercial deposits grow faster in the third quarter. That weighed on net interest margins which pushed the bank further from its year-end goal. Citizens up a little bit here. First Horizon plunging by nearly 9%, PNC off by 4%. 00:28 Speaker A Next up is Apple. It's updating its top-of-the-line products with its in-house chip. The refresh will be for the iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro. All will use the M5 chip except for the headband in the Vision Pro. Across the board, Apple is touting the M5's faster intelligence intelligent faster artificial intelligence processing capabilities. Besides the M5, the company's outfitting the latest iPad Pro with other in-house components as well. All of this comes ahead of the crucial holiday season. 00:58 Speaker A And finally Abbott, cutting the top end of its earnings guidance. The Trump administration launched an investigation into the medical device sector that could lead to tariffs on its biggest product category.

The move comes as the iPhone maker shifts away from Chinese manufacturing to escape the crossfire of the US–China trade war. Kerux Financial chief investment officer David Laut and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré discuss the details. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A According to Bloomberg, the consumer tech giant is making Vietnam the hub for manufacturing its upcoming line of smart home devices as it works to reduce its dependence on China. Uh, Apple is also partnering with Chinese tech firm BYD for final assembly, testing and packaging of the new products. This coming as the US and China remain locked in tense trade negotiations, with fresh uncertainty around tariffs and supply chains. But the shift to Vietnam won't completely alleviate tariff headaches for Apple. Products shipped from the country still face a 20% levy under the latest tariffs. So, so with me our roundtable for today, David, Brooke, and Inez. And David, you were just saying how Apple has been diversifying its supply chain away from China. But, I mean, does this just sort of pass around the risk considering Vietnam still has those tariffs? 00:50 David I think so, but I think it's dealing with a government and an economy that uh, is more willing to uh negotiate, right? The Chinese are going to hold a hard line because they want to show that power. Uh, they were referencing different types of powerful animals that they want to uh, you know, emulate. And so ultimately it's less of I think, um, uh, you know, a kind of a political posturing that we're dealing with. And the more or the more countries that we can kind of get these supply chains reoriented to, really coming out of COVID, right? This is where this all started. Uh the better off the global economy is, really. Um, you know, I think that if we can have more diversification, just like always, that's a positive thing. Of course, I'm going to say that. 01:38 Speaker A And Inez, I mean, this also just underscores how a lot of these big tech companies are exposed to these geopolitical tensions. How are you viewing that across not only Apple stock, but the chip space at large? 01:52 Inez Um well, look, I mean, the tariff situation is still a wild card particularly when it comes to China. And you have UBS that recently came out with comment basically saying that they see that the risk is some near-term two-way volatility, especially when it comes to chip and with tech. But they're still saying that basically cooler heads would they believe will ultimately prevail and they're saying any dip you see is a way to allocate into the stock market.

UBS said its dataset, which tracks iPhone availability in 30 markets, shows that “wait times for the iPhone 17 lineup continue to trend flattish to lower WoW across key geographies.” The bank noted that this pattern mirrors last year’s trends for the iPhone 16 series and is expected to continue going forward. In the United States, UBS said “wait times for the Pro declined ~9 days WoW” while “the Air and Base wait times are consistent WoW.” It added that “wait times for the Pro Max ticked lower by ~4 days WoW ex-China and are now lower on a YoY basis on average.” By model, U.S. wait times currently stand at around 21 days for the iPhone 17 Pro Max, compared with 24 days for the 16 Pro Max and 30 days for the 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 17 Pro is reportedly experiencing wait times of about 10 days, down from 18 days for the 16 Pro. However, the iPhone 17 Base continues to show elevated wait times of roughly 18 days, versus one day for the 16 Base. UBS also highlighted that Apple “has received approval to begin selling the iPhone 17 Air in China,” with preorders starting October 17 and availability on October 22. UBS maintained a price target of $220 on Neutral-rated Apple, valuing the stock at roughly “28x our blended CY26/CY27 EPS estimate of $7.91.” Related articles UBS: iPhone 17 wait times continue to trend flattish to lower WoW 8 Warren Buffett-Backed Stocks to Navigate September Volatility Natural Gas: Consolidation Could Set Stage for Breakout Above $3.20 Barrier View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

Apple said the chip, the company's most recent homegrown processor, includes an upgraded CPU and a 10-core GPU with neural accelerators in each core. That, Apple said, means the M5 provides four times the GPU compute performance compared to the M4 and six times compared to the M1. Graphics performance is 35% faster than the M4 and 2.5 times faster than the M1. The CPU also offers 15% better multithreaded performance than the M4. Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro is the company's first laptop to get the M5 chip. (Image: Apple) · Apple That, the company said, works out to 3.5 times better AI performance than the M4-equipped MacBook Pro and iPad Pro. The 14-inch MacBook Pro also gets up to 32GB of higher bandwidth memory and faster storage, which should add up to a speedier overall feel compared to prior generations of the laptop. As for battery life, Apple claims the M5-powered 14-inch MacBook Pro will last up to 24 hours on a single charge. The iPad Pro, available in both 11-inch and 13-inch varieties, also gets up to 16GB of faster memory and up to 1TB of storage, though the base model gets 12GB and 256GB of memory and storage, respectively. The new iPads are also the first to come with Apple's custom C1X cellular model and N1 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips. Physically, the iPads are the same as their predecessors, so don't expect the kind of flashy refresh like Apple provided with the iPhone Air. The iPad Pro line also gets Apple's M5 chip. (Image: Apple) · Apple Apple is clearly positioning its latest chip and products as AI powerhouses for developers and users alike. It's part of a broader industry push in the PC space to telegraph to customers that their devices are more than capable of handling certain AI tasks. Microsoft and its Windows partners are making a similar push with their AI PCs. And while the company is angling to get more recent MacBook and iPad users to upgrade to its newest hardware, it's also trying to entice older MacBook users with Intel-powered systems to make the jump to its latest laptops and tablets. In 2024, the Mac business generated $29.98 billion in revenue, while the iPad segment brought in $26.69 billion. The iPhone, however, saw $201.18 billion, and services raked in $96.17 billion. Apple's MacBook and iPad lines are its two smallest businesses, though they carry a good deal of cachet in creative circles, thanks to their video and photo editing capabilities.

      "text": "Braving Trump, Apple's Tim Cook promises to boost China investment By Xiuhao Chen and Joe Cash October 15, 2025 3 min read In this article: AAPL By Xiuhao Chen and Joe Cash BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple 's Tim Cook pledged to boost the tech giant's investment in China on Wednesday as it navigates the trade war between Beijing and Washington. Many U.S. companies have become cautious about relations with China as the world's two biggest economies clash over tariffs and as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to promote manufacturing in the United States rather than elsewhere. But Cook told China's industry minister Li Lecheng the iPhone maker will keep investing in China, according to an official summary of their meeting in Beijing released by the Chinese, although it gave no details of the size of the potential investment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The California-based company, which has also made investment pledges to Washington, has so far remained relatively unscathed by the trade war between the United States and China. Other companies, such as Nvidia and Qualcomm have found themselves the target of Chinese investigations. Washington has long placed sanctions on Chinese companies such as Huawei. BALANCING ACT A Shanghai-based government affairs consultant, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with media, said U.S. companies are wary of angering a White House that could hurt them at home in the world's biggest consumer market for appearing too pro-China. At the same time, they are seeking to avoid appearing insincere in Beijing where they have pledged to be \"in China, for China\", he added. Cook in August presented Trump with a custom U.S.-made plaque mounted on a 24-carat gold stand commemorating Apple's \"American Manufacturing Program\", after saying it would invest an additional $100 billion in domestic manufacturing. When Cook visited China in March, Apple made public its plans for a new clean energy fund there worth 720 million yuan ($101 million). Meanwhile, Apple, which relies on suppliers and factories in China where most of its iPhones are assembled, has been trying to shift some manufacturing capacity to India. Apple's COO Sabih Khan on Tuesday visited Lens Technology, a Chinese glass supplier for Apple, the Changsha-based company said in a statement on Wednesday. Lens Technology produces glass covers for Apple products including the iPhone and Apple Watch and has been a partner for 19 years, it said. China hopes Apple will continue to explore the Chinese market and grow together with Chinese suppliers, the industry minister, Li Lecheng, who is also in charge of infotech, told Cook, adding that China would continue to foster a good business environment for foreign companies, including Apple. Story Continues 'CHOOSING CHINA' Apple's shipments in China grew 0.6% from a year earlier to 10.8 million units in the third quarter against the backdrop of sluggish demand in China's smartphone market, according to data research firm IDC on Wednesday. Boosted by the iPhone 17 series, it was the only brand among China's three biggest vendors to achieve growth in shipments during the period. As part of his visit to China this week, Cook visited Apple's store in Shanghai and met Chinese game developers and the designer of the popular Labubu dolls, he said in posts on China's X-like Weibo. On Monday, he said the iPhone Air would be available for pre-order in China after the industry ministry cleared the way for major telecom operators to support its eSIM functionality. \"The business community has always been a stabiliser of China-U.S. relations and a promoter of pragmatic cooperation,\" China's ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said during an event in Washington on Tuesday. Many U.S. companies have \"chosen China\" and are benefiting both countries, Xie added.

The 95-year-old investor runs Berkshire Hathaway, with its trillion-dollar market capitalization, building the insurance- and stock-focused conglomerate from a tiny company 60 years ago to a force in the financial world today. During the past few years, Buffett has begun selling off some of his major stock holdings to raise cash, piling into U.S. Treasury bonds in the process. Last quarter, he sold 46.3 million shares of two of his favorite positions. Should you follow Buffett by trimming your own stock portfolio and buying short-term Treasuries? Expand NYSE : BRK.B Berkshire Hathaway Today's Change ( 0.40 %) $ 1.94 Current Price $ 492.10 Key Data Points Market Cap $1062B Day's Range $ 489.40 - $ 492.98 52wk Range $ 437.90 - $ 542.07 Volume 3.2M Avg Vol 4.3M Gross Margin 24.15 % Dividend Yield N/A Diminishing Apple stake One of the best investments Warren Buffett ever made is Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) . After purchasing shares about a decade ago, Berkshire Hathaway ended up with about 5% of the smartphone maker and rode the stock up to a whopping $175 billion valuation, at least as of the end of 2023. Since the end of 2023, Buffett has begun to sell pieces of his Apple stake. Last quarter, he sold another 20 million shares, with the stake now at $57 billion even though Apple stock keeps climbing. Berkshire Hathaway now owns less than 2% of Apple's shares outstanding . Why would Buffett trim Apple? Likely because of the stock's increasing valuation and decreasing growth prospects. Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio ( P/E ) of 39, which is well above what Buffett likes in a stock -- his typical range is 5 to 15 -- and even above the S&P 500 index average of 31 right now. This valuation places large expectations on Apple's future growth. That growth has not materialized recently. During the past three years, Apple's revenue is up a cumulative 5.4%, growing significantly slower than other large technology peers. Combine that with a high P/E, and you can see why Buffett has begun to sell Berkshire's stake in Apple stock. Image source: The Motley Fool. Trimming a large banking position The third largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio is Bank of America ( BAC +1.57% ) . It's one of the largest banks in the U.S., with close to $2 trillion in total deposits. Buffett made an investment in the company during the 2011 market downturn, eventually owning 12% of its shares outstanding by the end of 2022. Buffett saw Bank of America as a cheap financial stock in a time of turmoil. In 2011, the business was unprofitable, but has since gotten back on even footing and generated positive earnings per share ( EPS ) in each of the past 10 years, growing 156% during that time frame. Last quarter, Buffett reduced his position in Bank of America by 4%. Why is Buffett still selling Bank of America when Berkshire Hathaway already has a gargantuan cash pile? Like Apple, this is due to Bank of America's elevated valuation. The stock now trades at a price-to-book ratio ( P/B ) of 1.4, a key valuation metric for a banking stock. Anything above 1 means that Bank of America is valued at more than the equity reported on its balance sheet. On top of this, digital banks such as SoFi Technologies are bringing in new competition for consumer banking, taking deposits from legacy players like Bank of America. BRK.B Cash and Short-Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Should you follow Buffett into Treasuries? Instead of piling into different stocks, Buffett is taking the cash raised from selling Apple and Bank of America shares and buying short-term Treasury bonds issued by the federal government. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates beginning in 2022, holders of Treasury bonds have received higher annual interest rates. Even though interest rates have begun falling, the three-month Treasury bond is still yielding about 4% as of this writing. Berkshire has cash and equivalents of more than $300 billion, much of which is in short-term U.S. Treasuries. This should tell investors that Buffett thinks the risk-free return of about 4% offered by these bonds is a better investment than most stocks today, even his existing holdings like Apple and Bank of America that he has begun to trim. Should you follow Buffett and buy some Treasury bonds? This is a personal question that depends on your financial situation. If you hold a lot of growth and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, it might be smart to diversify and add some Treasuries to balance out your portfolio. This can be easily done through exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) with low annual fees, which make it easier for individual investors to obtain exposure to the bonds. Don't get too caught up with soaring stocks in a bull market. Perhaps it is time to follow Warren Buffett and diversify with Treasury bonds in your investment portfolio.

In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield.

The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain s , and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable.

REUTERS/Bhawika Chhabra · Reuters By Aditya Kalra, Nikunj Ohri and Aditi Shah October 15, 2025 4 min read In this article: AAPL 601138.SS By Aditya Kalra, Nikunj Ohri and Aditi Shah NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple is lobbying India's government to modify its income tax law to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers, an issue seen as a hurdle to its future expansion, sources say. The push coincides with Apple's growing India presence as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research says iPhone's share in the Indian market has doubled to 8% since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75% of global iPhone shipments, India's share has quadrupled to 25% since 2022. India is the world's second-largest mobile market. Apple's contract manufacturers Foxconn and Tata have pumped in billions of dollars to open five plants, but millions of those expenses go into acquiring pricey machines for iPhone assembly. Experts say Apple potentially faces billions of dollars in additional taxes if it changes its business practices without convincing New Delhi to change a 1961 law covering foreign ownership of equipment used in India. In China, Apple procures the machines used to make iPhones and gives them to its contract manufacturers, and is not subject to tax even though it still owns them. But that's not possible in India as the Income Tax Act would consider such ownership by Apple as a so-called \"business connection\", making the U.S. firm's iPhone profits liable for Indian taxes, said a senior government official and two other industry sources. Apple executives have held talks with the Indian officials in recent months to tweak the law as it fears the current legislation could hamper its future growth, said the sources. \"Contract manufacturers cannot put up money beyond a point,\" said the first industry source. \"If the legacy law is changed, it will become easy for Apple to expand ... India can become more competitive globally.\" Reuters is first to report Apple's concerns and lobbying efforts on the law. Apple did not respond to Reuters questions, and neither did India's IT and finance ministries who are involved in the discussions. INDIA CAUTIOUSLY REVIEWING APPLE REQUEST Smartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda, and India's deputy IT minister last year privately said China and Vietnam could race ahead as major smartphone export hubs due to their lower tariffs on phone parts. A senior Indian official said \"discussions on taxation rules impacting Apple are ongoing\", but New Delhi is cautious as any changes to the law could diminish its sovereign right to tax a foreign company. Story Continues \"It's a tough call,\" said the official, who highlighted that Apple's increased investments are equally important. \"India needs investments. We have to find a solution.\" Apple has since 2023 opened a handful of directly-owned retail stores in India, though it also sells it products through online and offline distributors. Foxconn and Tata have over the years invested more than $5 billion in setting up Apple manufacturing. SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT CAN COST BILLIONS One precedent of Indian law often cited by tax experts involves UK-based Formula One. India's Supreme Court held in 2017 that even though F1 did not own a circuit near New Delhi, it was liable to pay tax on profits for the days when it exerted full control during its Grand Prix India event. If Apple were to own machines inside Indian iPhone factories, it would amount to exerting control under current laws, experts said. \"If the activities of Apple constitute a business connection, then the global revenue may be used as a basis to compute the income attributable in India, leading to billions in tax exposure,\" said Riaz Thingna, a partner at Grant Thornton Bharat LLP. Taiwan's Foxconn is Apple's largest contract manufacturer in India, having shipped products worth $7.4 billion this year by August, compared to $7.5 billion in all of 2024, commercially available customs data shows. The income tax law, however, does not bother Apple's South Korean rival Samsung as almost all of its phones are made in its own Indian factories. The India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which backs Apple, has in a confidential representation to the government called for changes to the law, saying tax certainty is \"paramount for businesses seeking to expand and scale.\" \"Typical CMs (contract manufacturers) are unable or unwilling to invest in such large quantities of specialized equipment ... The cost of the equipment can rise to billions of dollars,\" ICEA said, without naming any company. \"In certain cases (it) may also be supplied ... free of cost.\" (Reporting by Aditya Kalra, Nikunj Ohri and Aditi Shah; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Kim Coghill) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices More Info"

By Keith Speights – Oct 15, 2025 at 4:44AM Key Points Buffett has been selling the biggest AI stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio Wall Street remains generally bullish about the stock. Buffett's reasons for selling might have little to do with the stock's prospects. NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Market Cap $3.9T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.25 %) $ 3.24 Current Price $ 262.82 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET The Oracle of Omaha is going against the majority opinion on Wall Street with some of his recent moves. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies ever seen. Unsurprisingly, the stocks of companies that are investing heavily in AI have attracted investors like bees to honey. But there's one famous investor who hasn't jumped aboard the AI bandwagon: Warren Buffett. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio includes only a few holdings that most would classify as AI stocks , and the billionaire investor has been selling shares of one of those ultra-popular companies. Does Buffett know something Wall Street doesn't? Image source: The Motley Fool. Buffett has been selling his biggest holding You might have already figured out that the stock in question is Apple ( AAPL +1.25% ) . The consumer technology giant has incorporated AI into its products for years. For example, Apple introduced its virtual assistant Siri as part of the iPhone 4 in 2011, and fourteen years is a long time in the fast-paced AI space. Buffett initiated a huge position in Apple in 2016 and kept buying more shares over the next couple of years. The stock soon became the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. For a while, Apple made up close to 50% of the conglomerate's equity investments. However, the legendary investor seemed to lose interest in Apple to some extent beginning in late 2023. At first, Buffett only sold a small portion of Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker. But in the second and third quarters of 2024, he sold roughly 489 million shares. After hitting the pause button for a couple of quarters, Buffett resumed selling Apple shares in the second quarter of 2025. Sure, Apple remains Berkshire's largest position . However, the stock now makes up 23.4% of the conglomerate's total portfolio -- less than half its peak percentage. Expand NASDAQ : AAPL Apple Today's Change ( 1.25 %) $ 3.24 Current Price $ 262.82 Key Data Points Market Cap $3900B Day's Range $ 259.18 - $ 264.13 52wk Range $ 169.21 - $ 265.29 Volume 38M Avg Vol 55M Gross Margin 46.68 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % What Wall Street thinks about Apple Buffett has never cared about what Wall Street thinks. However, most analysts wouldn't have advised him not to sell Apple. Only 3 of the 48 analysts surveyed by S&P Global in October had a sell or underperform rating for the stock. Wedbush's Dan Ives is especially bullish about Apple. He views the demand for the company's new iPhone 17 as strong and set a 12-month price target for Apple stock that reflects an upside potential of roughly 26%. Morgan Stanley is another Wall Street firm that's upbeat about Apple's prospects. Its analysts, like Ives, think iPhone 17 sales will be better than expected. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for Apple to around 21% above the current share price. What about the outliers on Wall Street who are negative about Apple? Jefferies is concerned about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on Apple's margins. Its analysts also look for minimal sales growth for Apple's products outside of its iPhones. Does Buffett know something that analysts don't? Buffett's decision to significantly trim Berkshire's position in Apple definitely goes against the majority opinion on Wall Street. Does the Oracle of Omaha know something that analysts don't? Could he anticipate that Apple will continue to lose ground in generative AI ? Does Buffett believe that the company won't be able to compete effectively in the smart glasses market? Maybe, but I doubt it. In Berkshire Hathaway's 2024 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett talked about how capital gains taxes could increase in the future, with the U.S. government having to raise funds to pay its debt. He hinted that the sales of Apple stock were a tax-saving move. It's also possible that Buffett wanted his successor, Greg Abel, to have ample cash to make one or more big acquisitions. Abel will take over as Berkshire's CEO when Buffett steps down at the beginning of 2026. Whatever the reason for selling Apple stock, Buffett remains a fan of the company. He told shareholders at Berkshire's annual meeting earlier this year that the only quarterly investment call he listens to is Apple's. Buffett also recognized Apple CEO Tim Cook at the meeting, stating that Cook \"has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway.\" About the Author Keith Speights is a contributing Motley Fool healthcare analyst covering publicly traded companies across pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, technology, and marijuana.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 ( ^FTSE ) underperformed against its European peers during the session. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that government debt across the world is on course to hit 100% of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2029 , the highest level since the aftermath of the second world war. Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, said on Wednesday that global public debt levels could soar as high as 123% of GDP by the end of the decade under an \"adverse, but plausible scenario\". According to analysis in the IMF's Fiscal Monitor report, aggregate government debt rose quicker than expected before the COVID pandemic , when policymakers stepped into protect people and bail out businesses. It came as Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell signalled that more interest rate cuts were on the way. Powell left the door open to further rate cuts on Tuesday night, and said the end of the US central bank’s long-running effort to shrink the size of its holdings may be coming into view.

The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year gilts has dropped by four basis points to 4.54%, down from 4.58% last night. Longer-dated borrowing costs are also lower, with the yield on 30-year gilts dropping by three basis points to 5.35%. Elsewhere, the US-China trade war has deepened as president Donald Trump is considering terminating cooking oil purchases from China, in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy US soybeans. Posting on his Truth Social site, Trump said: \"I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China.\" Story Continues Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio London’s benchmark index ( ^FTSE ) was down 0.3% by the end of the day. Germany's DAX ( ^GDAXI ) was muted, down around 0.1%, while the CAC ( ^FCHI ) in Paris headed 2.1% into the green after French prime minister Sébastien Lecornu promised to suspend Emmanuel Macron’s landmark pension reforms. The pan-European STOXX 600 ( ^STOXX ) was up 0.6%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) moved up around 0.5% by the time of the European close, following a rocky session on Tuesday for markets.

Wed, October 15, 2025 at 2:14 PM UTC LaToya Harding Nvidia stock rises amid HSBC upgrade Nvidia ( NVDA ) shares rose 2% premarket on Wednesday as HSBC ( HSBA.L ) analyst Frank Lee upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold. Lee said he expects the market for Nvidia's AI chips to keep growing beyond its Big Tech customers — pointing to the Stargate AI projects in the US and abroad and OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) recent deal with Nvidia — \"leading to continuous earnings growth\" for the chipmaker. Lee raised his price target on shares to $320 from $200. Also boosting Nvidia's shares was the company's participation in another multibillion-dollar deal in the AI space. An investor consortium called the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), which includes the AI chip giant, BlackRock ( BLK ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Elon Musk's xAIm said it will acquire 100% of the equity in data center company Aligned Data Centers. The transaction would value Aligned Data Centers at roughly $40 billion. AIP's investment is the latest in a tangled web of AI deals involving vendors of AI infrastructure investing in their own customers, and vice versa — a circular dynamic that analysts warn is contributing to a stock market bubble . Wed, October 15, 2025 at 1:56 PM UTC LaToya Harding IMF issues stark warning on global government debt The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that government debt across the world is on course to hit 100% of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2029, the highest level since the aftermath of the second world war. Vitor Gaspar, head of the International Monetary Fund's fiscal affairs department, said on Wednesday that global public debt levels could soar as high as 123% of GDP by the end of the decade under an \"adverse, but plausible scenario\". This is just under the all-time high of 132% reached just after World War II in 1948, when the world’s large economies had been devastated by six years of war and the costs of rebuilding. According to analysis in the IMF's Fiscal Monitor report, aggregate government debt rose quicker than expected before the COVID pandemic , when policymakers stepped into protect people and bail out businesses. “Looming expenditures on defence, natural disasters, disruptive technologies, demographics, and development add to public spending demands. All these pressures and demands come together with sharp political red lines against tax increases and diminished public awareness of fiscal limits,” it said. “Many emerging markets and low-income countries face tougher fiscal challenges, despite their relatively low debt.\" The IMF urged governments to help bolster the world economy and make debts more sustainable by switching spending to growth-friendly areas such as infrastructure and education. The UK was among the G20 countries whose ratio is set to peak above 100% of GDP in the coming years, along with the US, China, France, Japan and Canada. For Britain, the IMF forecasted total public debt would peak at 105.9% of GDP in 2029, before declining slightly, to 105.4% in 2030. The US is projected to surpass 140% of GDP by the end of the decade, and China's public debt was also rising sharply, surging from 88.3% of GDP to an expected 113% by 2029 As many as 55 countries were experiencing debt distress, or at high risk of distress, despite having debt-to-GDP ratios below 60%. Borrowing is far more expensive now than the period between the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the pandemic that began in 2020, Gaspar added.

State of Alabama and Tech Non-Profit Team-up to Boost Economic Opportunity in State's Most Rural Communities PR Newswire October 14, 2025 5 min read In this article: AAPL Groundbreaking $16M investment in the nonprofit Ed Farm with support from Apple and Alabama Power will bring critical tech training and broadband infrastructure to Alabama's \"Black Belt\" and beyond BIRMINGHAM, Ala. , Oct. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The State of Alabama, in partnership with the nonprofit Ed Farm, today announced the launch of the Alabama Digital Education Network (ADEN), an ambitious statewide workforce initiative that will establish a network of cutting edge \"learning spaces\" within the state's most rural communities. Backed by more than $16 million in new state funding, alongside programmatic and technology support from Apple and a connectivity partnership with Alabama Power, ADEN will establish future-focused community learning hubs in collaboration with anchor institutions including libraries, community centers, and schools. \"The launch of the Alabama Digital Education Network is a landmark moment for our state\" shared Alabama Governor Kay Ivey \"Alabama is a national leader in both workforce development and broadband connectivity, and this initiative builds on that success by ensuring every student has access to the tools they need to succeed in our modern economy. We are bridging the digital divide, bringing the power of technology and high-quality education and workforce training directly to our most rural communities, and securing a brighter future for all Alabamians.\" According to Alabama Speaker of the House, Nathaniel Ledbetter : \"Advancing Alabama's digital infrastructure plays a vital role in developing our workforce and providing strong opportunities for the people of our state. ADEN is much more than just a partnership with Ed Farm and Apple — it is a lifeline for West Alabama and will have a generational impact on the region. This project has been over two years in the making, and I'm incredibly grateful for all of Alabama's public and private partners' support. Structured as a public–private partnership, ADEN will be delivered by Alabama-based nonprofit, Ed Farm, which will utilize Apple's cutting-edge curriculum through its Apple Foundation Program. The program offers Alabama residents an opportunity to build in-demand digital skills, address community challenges with technology, and create. \"At Apple, we have always believed in the power of education to create opportunity for learners of all ages, equipping people with the skills and tools to reach their highest potential,\" said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives . \"We have longstanding relationships here in Alabama to support teachers, students, and adult learners, and we are thrilled to build on that work alongside Ed Farm and state leaders.\" Story Continues The initiative builds upon a strong record of success: in just five years Ed Farm, with support from Apple, has already produced over $1M 1 in wage gains for Alabama workers through its Pathways to Tech program. \"This partnership will allow us to expand and accelerate our mission to grow digitally fluent learners who are prepared for the future of work,\" said Waymond Jackson, President of Ed Farm . \"By scaling our proven model, we can create lasting economic opportunity across the Black Belt.\" Delivering a digital learning experience at scale will be made possible with Alabama Power's connectivity infrastructure. \"Since 2017, we've installed more than 2,000 miles of fiber to make our grid stronger and support faster restoration efforts,\" said Alabama Power President and CEO Jeff Peoples . \"We're grateful this infrastructure investment is helping ADEN advance workforce development and educational opportunities across rural Alabama.\" ADEN's Montgomery hub at Alabama State University will serve as the largest site in the network, occupying multiple floors in the Alabama State Continuing Education Building in downtown Montgomery. As a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) rooted in the heart of the Black Belt, ASU brings crucial educational partnership and deep community ties to the initiative. \"Alabama State University is proud to serve as the Montgomery hub for this transformative initiative\" said Dr. Quinton Ross, Jr. President of Alabama State University . \"As a Historically Black College and University rooted in the heart of the Black Belt, we understand the vital role access to digital infrastructure plays in closing opportunity gaps and empowering communities. This partnership allows Alabama State to continue setting the pace in workforce innovation and community impact bringing bold, tech-driven solutions to the forefront of education. This initiative marks yet another historic milestone in our mission to lead, serve, and uplift.\" Legislative leadership played a critical role in appropriating funding and convening program stakeholders, which drew broad geographic, and bipartisan support. State Senator Bobby Singleton , who represents the 24th district, believes that \"The launch of ADEN will be a transformative moment for the Black Belt with the potential to close long-standing gaps in access and ensure that every Alabamian has a fair shot at success in the modern workforce.\" For more information, please visit: edfarm.org/aden .

The rules announced last week require overseas firms to obtain Chinese government approval before exporting products containing even trace amounts of certain rare earths that originated in China. They prompted threats of punitive measures from Washington even as both sides signal an openness to talks, and pushback from the European Union. Most Read from Bloomberg HUD Issues Layoff Notices, Targeting Fair Housing Staff With Deep Cuts Affordable Housing Left Vulnerable After Trump Fires Building Inspectors With Roles as Civic Hubs, Libraries Turn Over a New Page DC Tourists Frustrated by Museum Closures as Shutdown Persists Chicago Commuter Rail to Increase Fares to Plug Budget Gap US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he might stop trade in cooking oil with China, ostensibly to retaliate against Beijing’s refusal to buy American soybeans. He previously threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on goods from China by Nov. 1 and raised the prospect of canceling his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. The European Union “should have a tough response,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, whose country chairs the EU’s rotating presidency, said Tuesday. EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis charged China with “using trade interdependencies for political gain,” speaking in Washington as global finance chiefs gathered for fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. While the degree of disruption will hinge on how broadly the new rules will be applied, the move has already energized companies and policymakers alike to look for potential counter-measures, and eventual alternatives to China’s critical inputs. “We will not let these export restrictions and monitoring go on,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox Business interview Monday. “They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world.” The American official said he expected to get coordinated support from Europe and India, along with other democratic governments in Asia — an apparent reference to nations such as Japan and South Korea. Dombrovskis said he expects discussions this week at a meeting of the Group of Seven in Washington. In India, automakers and parts suppliers have begun accelerating testing of ferrite-based magnets as a less efficient but geopolitically safer substitute for the heavy rare earths they previously relied on, according to people familiar with the matter. For now, they have enough inventory until December, the people said. Story Continues Taiwan’s economic minister, Kung Ming-hsin, said Tuesday the government will start encouraging local companies to recycle and refine rare earths to ensure a stable supply for its domestic industries. He said China’s latest measures will impact motor, car and drone makers, while the chip sector is largely unaffected. Meantime, tit-for-tat protectionist measures continue apace, beyond tariff hikes already imposed. China on Tuesday unveiled sanctions on US units of a South Korean shipping giant, part of a broader array of measures in the maritime space between Beijing and Washington. And the EU is considering forcing Chinese companies to hand over technology to European ones if they want to operate locally. WATCH: China sanctioned five US units of South Korean shipping giant Hanwha Ocean Co. and threatened further retaliatory measures on the industry. Rosalind Mathieson reports.Source: Bloomberg Backfire Risk The barrage of steps mark China’s first major effort to police the global flow of critical minerals it dominates, using the same playbook that allows the US to wield power far beyond its shores. “After decades of striving, China finally has a few real technological advantages over America,” wrote Arthur Kroeber and Laila Khawaja at Gavekal Research in a Monday note. Overly aggressive rare-earth implementation by China could supercharge efforts to build alternative supply chains, undermining China’s long-term dominance — the same way that Washington’s export controls on advanced semiconductors risk backfiring and spurring Chinese innovation. Australian mining companies with critical minerals projects made dizzying stock gains Tuesday, with shares of Resolution Minerals Ltd. closing up 56% and Nova Minerals Ltd. gaining 16%. China’s measures represent President Xi’s adaptation of tactics that were pioneered by the US — using dominance in critical sectors as a cudgel against foreign rivals. Where Washington has the capacity to wield the dollar to exercise long-arm jurisdiction, China is now deploying its stranglehold on rare earth processing and the production of permanent magnets. “The US has unmatched leverage in financial markets because of the dollar’s reach and because of the centrality of the US financial system,” said Chris Kennedy, a senior geoeconomic analyst at Bloomberg Economics who previously served at the National Security Council in the Biden and Trump administrations. “China has global leverage in its dominance of key industries that are essential to global manufacturing.” China’s Dominance The addition of five rare earths to China’s restricted list — holmium, europium, ytterbium, thulium and erbium — will make it harder for companies to find replacements for magnets made with the seven minerals that were originally affected by restrictions Beijing unveiled in April. In the short term, alternatives remain limited. China is responsible for 70% of the world’s mined rare earths and more than 90% of permanent magnets made with the minerals. While companies in the EU and US have previously reported supply shortages and production halts during earlier Chinese restrictions, building replacement capacity takes years. If rigorously enforced, the policy serves as a made-with-Chinese-technology chokepoint that affects virtually every modern industry that relies on high-performance permanent magnets. The measures apply not just to raw materials but to products made overseas using Chinese rare earth inputs — even when those materials make up as little as 0.1% of a product’s value. China’s Ministry of Commerce justified the restrictions on national security grounds, noting that medium and heavy rare earths have important military applications. Officials emphasized the measures would not prohibit exports entirely, and promised to approve applications meeting regulatory requirements. Regardless of the intent, the ambition to police the global flow of the minerals was captured in a Monday commentary by a researcher for the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government-linked think tank. Wang Ziyang, assistant research fellow at the institution, said China is shifting from being a supplier to a “governor of the rare earth order,” arguing that the measures prevent the military use of the elements and are in the common interest of the global community. The latest move caps years of expansion in Beijing’s export control regime. Since 2020, China has systematically built an architecture mirroring US controls, from blacklisting entities to establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction over Chinese-origin technology. The timing appeared linked to Washington’s lengthening of an entity list that targets Chinese semiconductor firms — a move that Beijing saw as violating bilateral understandings reached in Madrid last month that neither side would impose new controls during trade talks. The controls may serve as negotiating leverage ahead of expected discussions between Xi and President Donald Trump later this month. Kroeber and Khawaja said that the announcement set up a negotiation for Ch"

Apple doesn't store card numbers on Apple servers, so merchants and customers can rest assured that their data stays theirs.* Payroc Mobile gives businesses greater flexibility in how and where they accept payments—from the front counter to the sales floor to on-site appointments in the field. By eliminating the need for additional hardware, merchants can get started faster, reduce upfront costs, and scale with ease as their business grows. \"With Payroc Mobile, our sales partners can offer merchants a modern, flexible way to accept payments anywhere they do business,\" said Casey Conley, Chief Product Officer at Payroc. \"It enhances mobility, streamlines onboarding, and delivers the convenience customers expect—backed by enterprise-grade payment security.\" Merchants can start using Tap to Pay on iPhone in just a few simple steps. After enrolling with Payroc, they can download the Payroc Mobile app from the App Store and begin accepting contactless payments within minutes using an iPhone XS or later running the latest version of iOS. As businesses grow, Payroc Mobile grows with them. Whether expanding locations or adding staff, merchants can scale payment acceptance without the burden of purchasing new devices. Combined with Payroc's RewardPay Choice—a compliant surcharge program—businesses can manage processing costs while keeping the payment experience fast and frictionless. Coming soon, Payroc will also offer Tap to Pay on iPhone via SDK for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). This new SDK will enable software providers to embed Tap to Pay functionality directly into their iOS apps, allowing their merchants to accept contactless payments using only an iPhone—no extra hardware required. It's a fast, cost-effective way for ISVs to offer an integrated, mobile-first payment experience while reducing hardware dependencies and simplifying onboarding for their users.

United States Digital Payment Forecast Report 2025-2033, Competitive Analysis of ACI, Aliant Payment, Amazon, American Express, Apple, Fiserv, Mastercard, Novetti, Paypal, Visa Research and Markets October 14, 2025 6 min read In this article: AMZN AXP AAPL FI MA Company Logo The United States Digital Payment Market is set to experience remarkable growth, increasing from USD 3.06 trillion in 2024 to USD 9.29 trillion by 2033, with a CAGR of 13.11% from 2025 to 2033. Key drivers include high smartphone and internet penetration, evolving payment technologies, and changing consumer behavior. Digital platforms such as mobile wallets and online banking are gaining traction due to their convenience and security. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital payment adoption, making it a mainstream financial activity. Despite challenges like cybersecurity threats and a digital divide, the market continues to revolutionize commerce and consumer behavior nationwide. U.S. Digital Payment Market U.S. Digital Payment Market Dublin, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"United States Digital Payment Market Report by Type, Offering, End Use, States and Company Analysis, 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. United States Digital Payment Market is expected to witness tremendous growth, growing from US$ 3.06 trillion in 2024 to US$ 9.29 trillion by 2033. The growth depicts a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.11% during the period from 2025 to 2033. The growing usage of digital payments, the development of payment technologies, and evolving consumer behavior are primary drivers driving this market through the next few years. In the United States, digital payments have become extremely popular due to high smartphone penetration, widespread internet access, and consumer preference for convenience. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption, as contactless and online transactions became safer alternatives to cash. Businesses of all sizes - from large retailers to local vendors - are embracing digital payments to attract tech-savvy customers. With rewards, loyalty schemes, and robust security authentication, digital payment adoption continues to grow. It is now a mainstream financial activity in the United States, revolutionizing consumer behavior and trade. Drivers of Growth in the United States Digital Payment Market High Smartphone Penetration and Internet Penetration Nearly every American (98%) has a mobile phone. This means virtually 331 million individuals. Over nine in 10 (91%) Americans have a smartphone. The high penetration of smartphones and broadband internet is a main catalyst for the adoption of digital payments in the U.S. Customers are increasingly relying on mobile wallets, banking apps, and peer-to-peer systems for convenient transactions. As the rollout of 5G continues across the country, the speed and accuracy of digital payments are increasing, enabling real-time transfers. Companies are also embracing QR code and contactless payment solutions to keep up with customers' expectations. With mobiles becoming the fulcrum of shopping, banking, and bill payments, ease of online transactions remains a key driver of market growth. This technology platform provides constant growth of the digital payments ecosystem across the nation. Growth of E-commerce and Online Services The accelerated growth of e-commerce and subscription services has heavily contributed to digital payment acceptance in the U.S. Digital transactions underpin the business models of online stores, food delivery apps, streaming platforms, and ride-sharing apps for customer convenience. Safe checkout methods such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay speed up buying while curbing cart abandonment rates. One-click payments and stored cards further optimize user experience. Story Continues Since American consumers are spending billions of dollars every year on online shopping, payment platforms have become a must-have. This high correlation of retail digitization with consumer demand is a key growth driver of the market for digital payments. From June 2025, US visitors to BBC.com will have to pay $49.99 (£36) per annum or $8.99 (£6.50) per month for most BBC News articles and features, and to watch the BBC News channel, according to a statement on the website. Government and Regulatory Support for Cashless Transactions Initiatives from the government and regulations are driving the development of the U.S. digital payments market. Financial inclusion policies, cybersecurity guidelines, and digital infrastructure investment offer a solid base for adoption. Organizations such as the Federal Reserve facilitate innovation with initiatives such as FedNow, which allows immediate payments across the country. Besides this, tax relief for small businesses embracing digital transactions as well as continued emphasis on secure authentication mechanisms (such as biometric checks) build confidence in digital platforms. Such actions prompt consumers and businesses alike to switch from checks and cash to digital platforms, complementing the growth trend of digital payments in the United States. 86.9% of point of sale transactions in the United States were cashless in 2024. Challenges in the United States Digital Payment Market Cybersecurity Threats and Fraud Risks With increasing digital payments, cybersecurity threats are a major challenge to the U.S. Phishing attacks, data breaches, identity theft, and fraudulent activities erode consumer confidence in online platforms. Publicized instances of payment fraud tend to identify weaknesses in security systems, deterring nervous users from embracing digital solutions. Payment players have to heavily invest in tokenization, sophisticated encryption, and AI-based fraud detection to keep consumers confident. Even with these attempts, emerging cyber threats pose ongoing threats. Unless dealt with holistically, security issues would impede digital payment adoption, especially with older age groups that are still more hesitant to adopt online monetary transactions. Unequal Access and Digital Divide In spite of comprehensive growth, digital payment adoption is hampered by the digital divide in the U.S. Internet and sophisticated financial infrastructure are often absent in rural areas, hindering widespread adoption of online payments. Moreover, poor families might not own smartphones, bank accounts, or credit facilities needed to carry out digital transactions. The disparity inhibits the inclusive development of the digital payments market. Although governments and fintech players are attempting to bridge the financial inclusion gap through inexpensive alternatives and prepaid digital wallets, there are gaps yet to fill. Closing the urban-rural, rich-poor divide is necessary for broad adoption across the country.

New digital wealth channels that comply with laws and regulations are changing the U.S. pension system. In the United States, more and more retirees are quietly exploring a new field: the steady appreciation of digital assets . Instead of pursuing short-term speculation or high-risk projects, they chose regulated Sunny Mining , which provides automated, standardized daily settlements and generates up to $7,700 in passive income per day. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. Is AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Surprising as it may sound, this pattern has already begun to spread across U.S. financial markets. American retiree uses BTC through Sunny Mining to earn $7,700 in stable passive income every day U. S. retirement planning consultants and financial media say: Sunny Mining is becoming one of the most popular crypto-yield platforms in the private wealth management sector; its transparency, compliance, and stable returns provide new tool options for retirement planning. What is Sunny Mining? Founded in 2019 and headquartered in the UK, Sunny Mining is a cryptocurrency cloud mining company regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority . The platform provides decentralized computing power management and cloud mining solutions, supporting mainstream assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Ripple (XRP) . It covers 195 countries and regions , has 9,024000+ registered users, manages assets of US$730 million+, and holds 3,707 BTC and 80 million XRP to ensure liquidity. This means that users can participate in cloud mining in an automated and standardized manner within a compliance and security framework and obtain cash income settled on a daily basis . Why are more and more American retirees choosing Sunny Mining? Retirement planning in the United States is mainly based on long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)/IRA, but under long-term low interest rates and inflationary pressures, the actual purchasing power of many retirement funds has been eroded. Regulated Sunny Mining offers a digital finance path that focuses on automation and stable cash flow. Retirees can get started by simply depositing a small amount of money into supported crypto assets like XRP or BTC. The system will map these assets into computing power and automatically distribute them to a global network of 107 mining farms , pursuing continuous output through distributed computing power. Unlike traditional investment, this model weakens short-term dependence on market prices. Sunny Mining uses algorithmic computing power allocation and risk hedging as its core framework to achieve passive income through daily settlement and automatic accounting . Story Continues How do I get started? Step 1 | Register an Account Visit www.sunnymining.com and click \"Register.\" New users can receive a $15 registration bonus to experience the profit model.

Expert and investor voices TradingView recently reported: Sunny Mining's integration of traditional financial risk management with blockchain technology is becoming a milestone in the digital transformation of the U.S. pension market.

      "text": "Should You Buy MP Materials Right Now? By Steven Porrello – Oct 14, 2025 at 9:57AM Key Points MP Materials operates one of the few rare earth mines in the U.S. It has support from the Pentagon and Apple to build out its manufacturing power. Its magnets are found in a variety of appliances, from consumer devices to electric vehicles. NYSE : MP MP Materials Market Cap $13B Today's Change angle-down ( 3.45 %) $ 2.36 Current Price $ 70.81 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET MP Materials has crushed the market in 2025, with a 330% gain on the year. MP Materials ( MP +3.45% ) operates one of the few rare earth metal mines and processing facilities in the U.S. -- the Mountain Pass Mine in California. This mine is critical as feedstock for neodymium-iron-boron magnets, which are found in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and drones, among others. Expand NYSE : MP MP Materials Today's Change ( 3.45 %) $ 2.36 Current Price $ 70.81 Key Data Points Market Cap $13B Day's Range $ 69.36 - $ 72.59 52wk Range $ 15.56 - $ 100.25 Volume 11M Avg Vol 15M Gross Margin -2365.68 % Dividend Yield N/A To put it plainly, no other U.S. company can match in scale what MP Materials does, which is one reason the mining stock jumped 330% on the year. With a big push from the U.S. government, the stock may still have runway ahead. The convergence of several big tailwinds To understand MP Materials' big moment right now, just look at the larger context. China currently dominates the supply chain of rare earth metals . In 2024 alone, it accounted for about 65% of rare earth mining production. To put that into perspective, the U.S. came in second with a meager 11%. If China and the U.S. were on friendlier terms, that might not be significant. But since they're not, the White House has been issuing executive orders to shore up the nation's supply of metals. Back in July, the Department of Defense inked a huge multibillion-dollar deal with MP Materials. In exchange for a 15% stake in the company, MP got a variety of benefits, including a 10-year price floor of $110 per kilogram of neodymium-praseodymium. MP plans to use the DOD's investment to build up its 10X Facility, which could produce about 10,000 metric tons of magnets per year. Along with support from the Pentagon, MP also inked a $500 million deal with Apple . Under this agreement, MP will supply Apple with magnets made from recycled materials, the shipment of which should begin in 2027. The convergence of these tailwinds has sent MP stock soaring. Likewise, it's given it a rich valuation. At today's price, the company trades at roughly 81 times forward earnings , meaning a lot of expectation is baked in. As such, expect this stock to be bumpy in the near term. Investors with a long-term horizon stand to benefit most.

      "text": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It Zacks Equity Research October 14, 2025 5 min read In this article: AAPL ^SPX Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of +6.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.6% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $7.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 indicates a change of +6.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAPL Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $101.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $414.06 billion and $436.4 billion estimates indicate +5.9% and +5.4% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Apple reported revenues of $94.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. EPS of $1.57 for the same period compares with $1.4 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.75%. The EPS surprise was +10.56%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries. Focus Universal Inc. Launches Universal Smart IoT Apps NewMediaWire October 14, 2025 7 min read In this article: FCUV AAPL ONTARIO, CA - October 14, 2025 ( NEWMEDIAWIRE ) - Focus Universal Inc. ( NASDAQ : FCUV) (\"Focus\" or the \"Company\"), a provider of patented hardware and software design technologies for Internet of Things (IoT), 5G and SEC Financial Reporting AI-Driven Automation Software, is pleased to announce today that the company has launched the Universal Smart IoT App in Apple's app store and Google Play's app store. Although IoT has long been recognized as a revolutionary technology with the large potential to change the world - ranking as the top transformative technology, widespread adoption has been limited by high development costs and technical complexity. The customized nature of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and projects often requires bespoke designs built from scratch, leading to skyrocketing development and implementation costs. Focus Universal has dedicated over a decade to researching and overcoming these specific challenges, resulting in Universal Smart IoT - an innovative platform that radically simplifies IoT development and dramatically reduces associated costs. Unlike traditional IoT systems, where engineers start from scratch for each new device, the company's platform provides a pre-built common foundation. Utilizing Focus' platform, different IoT devices can share roughly 90% of the same hardware and software, substantially reducing development costs and complexity. This unique approach not only accelerates time-to-market but also democratizes access to IoT solutions. Further enhancing this ecosystem is Focus Universal's Universal Smart Software Platform , which eliminates the need for multiple device-specific applications. The company believes engineers no longer need to build separate apps for each IoT product - the company's platform supports them all without sacrificing performance or functionality, according to the company technology lead. This streamlined app development process can significantly cut costs and improve efficiency, allowing us to offer the company's IoT platform to customers at a fraction of the cost required to develop custom solutions One of the company's revolutionary products, the Ubiquitor , exemplifies this efficiency. The Ubiquitor can connect to any sensor - or even a large number of independent sensors - without theoretical limit. As more sensors are added, the average cost of the Ubiquitor per sensor becomes negligible. This results in an effective cost which approaches the cost of the sensors alone, already significantly lower than traditional devices. When used in conjunction with the company's universal platform, the total development cost is a fraction of conventional approaches, offering substantial savings in both raw materials and engineering time. Story continues To install the Universal Smart IoT App, search FCUV' in the Apple app store or Google Play's app store. The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms. The company believes this milestone signals a new era for the Internet of Things. Following two decades of innovation, the company is continuing to move forward with full-scale commercialization. In doing so, the company not only begins to complete its technology promise to shareholders but also demonstrates to the world that deploying complex IoT technology can be as easy as plugging in an office phone or other device. The company's platform provides both a competitive edge and cost savings even when compared to traditional, non-IoT devices - thanks to universal hardware and software shared across all sensors. Switching from one sensor to another requires no change to the underlying device's hardware or software, enabling true interoperability across devices. Additionally, Focus Universal's AI-driven SEC financial reporting software has been successfully demonstrated to several of the well-respected industry leaders within the SEC filing and compliance sector. SEC financial reporting is traditionally a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. The entire process may take several weeks. Delays in filing can result in SEC reviews, enforcement actions, and significant penalties. Focus Universal, by contrast, has developed a fully automated, end-to-end solution powered by both automation and Variegated AI, whereby Focus believes the technology enables the computer to conduct the activities for which the computer is designed and optimal and allows the human to remain within the decision loop and center upon what the human excels. With a single click, the company's software can: Retrieve financial statements from accounting platforms, Reformat data into spreadsheets for consolidated financial reporting, Automatically generate consolidated financials, Populate the word-processed version of SEC filings, Convert the documents to SEC-compliant versions via EDGARization, and Embed accurate tags into the HTML file - with very limited manual input. Built-in validation, including self-consistency and compliance checks, ensures accuracy and eliminates human error. Essentially, Focus believes what once took weeks of manual work can now be completed in minutes. Edgarization is the process of converting source documents - such as Microsoft Word, Excel, or PDF files - into the SEC-compliant Edgar HTML format. Traditionally, this process handles only ten pages per hour. The company's software, however, can process a hundred-page SEC financial report in a few seconds. Focus Universal is partnering with industry-leading partners to conduct real-time testing of this technology. The IoT market was valued at $540 Billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to $3.3 trillion by 2030 , with a CAGR of 26.1% . Yet despite its promise, industry surveys reveal that a majority of IoT projects fail - Cisco Systems reported a 75% failure rate, and Microsoft found that 30% of IoT projects fail at the early proof-of-concept stage. Focus Universal's Universal Smart IoT technology was specifically developed to overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of the IoT revolution. According to recent industry analysis, the Financial Reporting Software Market was valued at US $13.9 Billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to US $36.6 Billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.8%. The surge is driven by the increasing complexity of financial data, the high cost of compliance, and the need for scalable, efficient, and intelligent reporting tools. Focus believes this innovation does not replace the SEC-required review process but removes much of the labor-intensive, manual work, dramatically cutting preparation and revision time for public companies. About Focus Universal: Focus Universal Inc. is a provider of patented hardware and software design technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. The company had developed five disruptive patented technology platforms with 28 patents and patents pending in various phases and eight trademarks pending in various phases to solve the major problems facing hardware and software design and production within the industry today. As a process of maintenance without losing protection, the company is in the process of filing additional omnibus patents. These technologies combined to have the potential to reduce costs, product development timelines and energy usage while increasing range, speed, efficiency, and security. Focus currently trades on the Nasdaq Markets.

      "text": "Meet the Unstoppable Stock That Will Soon Join Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club By Bram Berkowitz – Oct 14, 2025 at 5:02AM Key Points Stocks that have hit a $3 trillion market cap have massive tech businesses benefiting from exuberance over AI. One stock approaching that level has had an up-and-down year but now seems to be on a good path. Alphabet has become a tech conglomerate and is seeing growth potential in several exciting businesses. NASDAQ : GOOGL Alphabet Market Cap $3.1T Today's Change angle-down ( 2.73 %) $ 6.92 Current Price $ 260.00 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:59 PM ET Very few stocks have a $1 trillion market cap, let alone a $3 trillion market value. Very few stocks can boast a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. But an even smaller, more elite group can boast market caps over $3 trillion. A decade ago, many analysts and investors would have laughed at the idea of a company surging past a $3 trillion market value. And even now, only the cream of the crop has elevated to this level, largely driven by extreme exuberance around artificial intelligence. The three that have surpassed a $3 trillion market cap are Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . But another AI hyperscaler will likely soon join them and has even surpassed a $3 trillion market cap for brief periods earlier this year. Emerging after a busy year No company has had a quiet year, due to the market scare in April from tariffs. But Alphabet ( GOOG +2.70% ) ( GOOGL +2.73% ) has had to overcome several hurdles before being able to rise nearly 27% this year to a roughly $2.9 trillion market cap (as of Oct. 9). Image source: Alphabet. The big one involved the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit against the tech conglomerate . It accused Google of monopolistic practices in search and digital advertising that made the landscape unfair for competitors, which therefore forced clients to use its products in a way that gave Google extreme pricing power. At the end of 2024, a federal judge sided with the DOJ and ruled that Google did indeed employ monopolistic practices to maintain its dominance in search. The DOJ then asked the judge to force Google to divest Chrome, which plays a big role in driving Google's search business that contributes over half of Alphabet's revenue. Recently, the judge issued a sentence that many investors believed to be quite benign. Not only did the judge let Google keep Chrome, but also essentially said it could keep paying companies like Apple to make Google their default search engine. Interestingly, part of the reason the judge failed to make Google divest Chrome is due to the rise of artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, which have made the search space far more competitive than it once was. This actually ties into another hurdle Google is facing related to the future of search. Users have flocked to chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity for their search needs, leaving many investors wondering what the search landscape will look like going forward. Expand NASDAQ : GOOGL Alphabet Today's Change ( 2.73 %) $ 6.92 Current Price $ 260.00 Key Data Points Market Cap $3143B Day's Range $ 255.33 - $ 261.68 52wk Range $ 140.53 - $ 261.68 Volume 1.4M Avg Vol 33M Gross Margin 58.92 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % However, Google has made progress in integrating AI capabilities to its search engine with features like Gemini overviews, which pop up at the top of many search queries and provide answers to questions in a similar manner to chatbots. Analysts at HSBC recently initiated coverage on Alphabet with a buy rating, specifically citing the search giant's progress in AI with Gemini overviews. The analysts said they expect AI overviews and Google's AI mode, which seeks to create more of a conversational AI search experience, should help the conglomerate maintain a 90% market share of the traditional search market. An AI pullback is possible, but Alphabet will reach $3 trillion sooner than later Investors are constantly speculating over what inning we are in of the AI game, but nobody really knows. I don't think that AI is a fad and it will likely be impacting our lives for decades to come. But the path may not be linear and I would not be surprised to see a pullback in the stock market or correction at some point. Regardless, Alphabet already hit a $3 trillion market cap in September  and I think it's only a matter of time before that happens again and Alphabet stays above that level permanently. The stock trades at about 24 times forward earnings , which is not exactly cheap, but not crazy compared to some of the other hot AI stocks out there. Alphabet also has several fast-growing and exciting businesses aside from its search business, including its autonomous driving division Waymo, its content powerhouse YouTube, and its cloud business, just to name some of the big ones. These should continue to power the stock higher over time.

The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. AAPL now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. Both paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025. Apple TV+ viewership soared double-digit year over year. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. AAPL expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter. However, gross margin is expected to be 46-47% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, including a tariff impact of $1.1 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors. (You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> ) Shares of Eli Lilly have gained +7.8% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +8.5%. Demand for the company’s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company’s key top-line drivers. Launches of these drugs in new international markets and improved U.S. supply from ramped-up production led to strong sales in the first half of 2025. Lilly’s other new drugs, like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca, are also contributing to its top-line growth. However, data from phase III studies on its weight-loss pill, orforglipron, was mixed. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined slightly ahead of Q3 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. (You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>> ) Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the year-to-date period (+10.2% vs. -6%). The company’s strong market position is underpinned by consistent volume-driven growth, acquisitions and technological leadership in digital payments. Expansion in cross-border volumes, rising transactions and investments in AI and stablecoin infrastructure enhance its future prospects. A robust financial position with ample liquidity and shareholder returns further supports long-term growth. However, it faces rising client incentives and expenses, which can weigh on margins. Regulatory pressures and potential legislative changes pose additional risks to its fee structure. While declining cash volumes align with its digital strategy, regional softness warrants monitoring. Moreover, Visa’s premium valuation suggests limited near-term upside. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released on Tuesday, showed that annual wage growth excluding bonuses in the three months to August was 4.7%, down slightly from 4.8% between May and July. The unemployment rate came in at 4.8% for the period, slightly higher than the 4.7% recorded for the previous three months. The number of employees on the payroll in the year to August was estimated to have fallen by 93,000, though it increased by 10,000 between July and August. Early estimates for the number of payrolled employees in September suggested a fall of 100,000 on the year and 10,000 on a monthly basis, though the ONS said this was likely to be revised when more data is received next month. The estimated number of job vacancies fell by 9,000 from the previous three months to 717,000 in July to September. Read more: 12 taxes you may not hear about in the budget – and what you can do about them Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: \"After a long period of weak hiring activity, there are signs that the falls we have seen in both payroll numbers and vacancies are now levelling off. \"We see different patterns across the age ranges with record numbers of over-65s in work, while the increase in unemployment was driven mostly by younger people.\" The figures come ahead of the government's autumn budget, which chancellor Rachel Reeves is due to deliver on 26 November, with speculation ramping up as to what policy changes she could announce to raise funds to support public finances. Professor Joe Nellis, an economic adviser at accountancy and advisory firm MHA, said that the labour market \"continues to show signs of strain\". \"Hiring momentum has slowed across most sectors, with many employers holding off on new recruitment or scaling back hours instead of making redundancies,\" he said. \"While this suggests a degree of resilience, it also signals that businesses are operating with caution amid fragile demand, elevated borrowing costs, and uncertainty ahead of the autumn budget.\" Story Continues Nellis said this is having a particular impact on the employment prospects of young people entering the workforce for the first time. \"The debate around AI rages on, and while some businesses are claiming that their entry-level recruitment is slowing as AI proves able to complete the more menial tasks that are often the responsibility of these employees, the more important driver of this is hiring costs,\" he said. \"The increase in the minimum wage and employer NICs [national insurance contributions] have made it difficult for businesses to invest in young talent, and we are seeing this reflected in the high levels of youth unemployment.\" Pay growth data is closely watched by the Bank of England (BoE) as it tries to keep inflation under control . The BoE opted to hold interest rates at 4% in September, with the central bank's next decision due on 6 November. Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the \"continued stickiness of wage growth will do little to prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates again this year\". \"But we think it’s only a matter of time before the loosening in the labour market leads to a more marked easing in wage growth, which would allow the Bank to cut rates from 4.00% now to 3.00% next year,\" he added.

      "text": "Rising pension age hits women hardest Helen Morrissey · Pensions columnist 14 October 2025 3 min read In this article: ^FTSE GBPEUR=X GBPUSD=X AAPL New data from the Department from Work and Pensions on the working patterns of people aged 50 and above showed that our working lives are getting ever longer , as the average age of leaving work rises. This trend isn’t just down to people’s enthusiasm for work; it’s primarily caused by increases to the state pension age – a change that has particularly impacted the working lives of women. With state pension age soon to start its rise to 67, it will be interesting to see whether people will work even later in life. Enabling people to work for longer can spell good news for people’s retirement planning , giving them longer to build their pensions or vary their working patterns by going part-time. However, there are significant challenges, most notably healthy life expectancy . Not everyone is physically able to keep on working. Poor health can also strike much earlier than you think. According to the data, 44.7% of people who are classed as economically inactive between the age of 50-64 say it’s because they are sick, injured or disabled. Read more: What you need to think about before taking a tax-free pension lump sum The other major challenge is caring responsibilities. This can cover not just looking after your own children but also grandchildren and parents. It’s something that can take you out of the workforce at any time. It also disproportionately affects women and is a key component of the burgeoning gender pension gap . More than 18% of women said it’s a reason why they can’t look for work, compared with 7.7% of men. Increases to the state pension age come with challenges such as having a healthy life expectancy and managing caring responsibilities. · Halfpoint Images via Getty Images These issues have enormous consequences for those who need to leave the workforce in their 50s. Shorter working lives mean less time to build up a workplace pension — and more time when people need to rely on the assets they have been able to build up so far. The rise in state pension age makes it even more challenging. If you were to leave the workforce at, say 55, you’ve got more than decade before you’ll get your state pension, so how do you fill that gap? It’s an issue that will no doubt be an important part of thinking around the ongoing review into state pension age. In the interim, it also means everyone needs to consider their own position if they were forced to finish work earlier, and whether there’s anything they can do to protect themselves. This can include anything from taking steps to build a bigger pension to investing in an ISA they can access if they need to before their personal pension is available. Read more: 12 taxes you may not hear about in the budget – and what you can do about them Story Continues For those leaving work for caring responsibilities, it shows the vital importance of enabling flexible working to help people balance work and caring. This, alongside good quality affordable childcare, will make it easier for parents to keep working where they can. The 50-plus population still has a lot to offer the workplace , and current challenges risk a significant loss of expertise for businesses. It also risks forcing people to stop work at a time when they still want to contribute. Allowing extra flexibility for older workers can mean both parties continue to benefit.

      "text": "How to ask for changes at work if you are neurodivergent Lydia Smith · Writer, Yahoo Finance UK 14 October 2025 5 min read In this article: AAPL +1.25% Asking for workplace accommodations is often easier said than done. Many people worry about being seen as “needy” or “incompetent,” and as a result, continue to struggle in environments that simply don’t meet their needs. On top of that, the fear of discrimination can be a powerful deterrent, discouraging many neurodivergent individuals from disclosing their diagnosis. As many as one in seven people are neurodiverse, with conditions including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia and dyspraxia. Yet, two-thirds of neurodivergent workers don’t feel able to tell their employers about their diagnoses – let alone ask for accommodations to make working easier. Natalie Mackenzie , a cognitive strategist and founder of BIS Services , which provides cognitive rehabilitation services, adds that people may worry that disclosing their needs will lead to being seen as less capable, or mean they’re passed over for promotions. “This is often compounded by past negative experiences in other environments, such as school or previous jobs,” she says. “Individuals may also struggle to articulate exactly what they need. If you have spent your life developing complex masking or coping mechanisms, it can be difficult to pinpoint the specific adjustments that would make a tangible difference. There is also the internalised pressure to ‘just cope’ which can make asking for help feel like an admission of failure rather than a proactive step towards having their needs met.” And even if individuals do tell their employers, it doesn’t automatically mean their needs will be met, says Professor Binna Kandola, co-founder of the business psychology firm Pearn Kandola . Read more: What to do if a lack of career confidence is holding you back “Our research shows that only 60% receive the adjustments they need, and 63% feel they have to ‘mask’ their true selves at work-often leading to stress, exhaustion and poorer mental health,” he explains. “This isn’t about individual reluctance – it’s about organisations still lacking the psychological safety that makes open conversations possible.” How to ask for accommodations at work Think about what adjustments may be helpful beforehand Everyone is different, but some common requests include greater flexibility around hours and location to avoid commuting at busy times, or so you can work during your peak focus hours. Others include quiet, sensory-friendly workspaces or access to noise-cancelling headphones, extra time for certain tasks and regular breaks to manage focus and energy. Another simple adjustment is asking for clear written communication to avoid anxiety, frustration or unintentional mistakes. For those who use language literally, being asked to “read between the lines” can mean a constant struggle to understand the intended meaning of an instruction. A reasonable change may be to ask for instructions to be given via email or instant messaging instead of spontaneous phone calls, or to have agendas provided before meetings. Weiterlesen “Access to software for project management, mind mapping or breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks can be helpful,” says MacKenzie. “Use of transcribing software and summaries can be really useful, where confidentiality allows. You could also ask for access to text-to-speech and speech-to-text software, use of coloured overlays or screen filters, and proofreading support for important documents.” Ultimately, she adds, the focus should be on “reasonable” adjustments. “The feasibility of an adjustment will depend on the size and resources of the organisation, the nature of the job, and the cost involved,” says MacKenzie. Go into the meeting with clear requests First, take some time to write down what you need and why. You may find it easier to create a checklist of what you need in written form if the conversation is anxiety-provoking, and many support organisations – such as ACAS – have templates available online. Read more: When 'job hugging' is a good idea — and when it holds you back “It can help to frame your request as a way to enhance your productivity and contribution to the company,” says MacKenzie. “Start the conversation by focusing on your commitment to your role and your desire to perform at your best. Instead of simply stating you have ADHD or dyslexia, come prepared with specific challenges and proposed solutions.” Remind your employer of the skills you bring to the role, whether it's creative problem-solving or exceptional attention to detail. If possible, refer to company values or policies that support inclusion – it keeps the focus on fairness, not favour. Give examples where possible Connect the challenge directly to a task and the adjustment directly to a solution. For example, instead of saying you struggle with distractions, try the phrase: “I find it difficult to maintain focus on deep work in the open-plan office. Would it be possible for me to use noise cancelling headphones or work from a quiet room for two hours each morning?” Write everything down Keep a record of your conversations, the adjustments agreed upon, and how they are working. This might be helpful if you end up with a different manager or colleague, who isn’t aware of your needs. It’s also useful for review meetings and can help you track which changes are working and which aren’t. Read more: Why job applications are getting more complicated – and putting off candidates Finding the right accommodations is often a process, rather than a single conversation. Don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself Under the UK's Equality Act 2010, employers have a legal duty to make “reasonable adjustments” for employees with disabilities, which includes neurodevelopmental conditions. You don't have to be an expert in the law, but knowing that this framework exists can give you confidence in these conversations. Advocating for yourself isn’t self-serving. It’s about creating a culture where others feel able to do the same and will create fair and equal conditions for everyone at work.

      "text": "Apple announces major expansion of renewables investment across Europe Rebecca Speare-Cole, PA Sustainability Reporter 13 October 2025 5 min read In this article: AAPL Apple has announced a major expansion of its renewables investment in Europe as part of efforts to cut the carbon footprint caused by customers powering and charging its devices. The tech giant is supporting several large-scale solar and wind farms that are currently in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Romania and Poland. This builds on its previously announced investment in the Castano solar farm outside the Spanish city of Segovia, which started operating earlier this year and can power around 76,500 households. While these projects will provide electricity directly to grids in their respective countries, Apple said the amount they generate will contribute towards its corporate climate goals. With the help of this new clean power capacity, the company aims to match 100% of the electricity used by its customers in Europe, including the UK, to power or charge their devices by 2030. It comes as part of Apple’s wider target to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain – its operations, supply chains and the products it sells – by the end of the decade. Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said: “By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity. The Castano solar farm outside the Spanish city of Segovia, which started operating earlier this year (Apple/PA) “Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies and secure energy sources across the continent.” The energy used to charge devices accounted for about 29% of Apple’s overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, according to the firm’s own calculations. This does not include the electricity required for its data centres, which the company said are already powered by renewable electricity. To reach its 2030 ambitions in Europe, Apple estimates that it will need to bring online 3,000 GWh of renewable energy a year to match the electricity customers use for charging. The projects announced on Tuesday will meet a third of this by generating more than 1,000 GWh a year, Apple said, adding that it will continue to expand its renewable investment in Europe ahead of 2030. Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives at the solar farm in Segovia, Spain (Apple/PA) The tech giant has recently come under scrutiny for its environmental claims amid concerns over some of the nature-based projects in which it invested to offset emissions. A German court in August ruled that adverts describing the Apple Watch as carbon neutral were misleading, and the firm is currently fighting a class action over a similar issue in the US. Asked about the legal cases, Ms Jackson told the PA news agency: “We welcome the scrutiny of what we’re doing and we’re trying to be as transparent as possible about how we’re doing it. Story Continues “When we talk about our products, when we talk about our company, we were very clear to put out exactly how we intend to get to carbon neutrality by 2030.” On how the firm balances the communication of its climate ambitions with the risk of greenwashing, she said: “Look, we know the work we’re doing – I know – and we have an obligation to explain that work. “We were proud to do it with our carbon neutral products. Solar panels at the 131MW solar farm developed by ib vogt in Segovia, Spain (Rebecca Speare-Cole/PA) “Unfortunately, we can’t talk about them that way any more but we’re not going to stop talking about the work that we do, and that’s what our customers should expect from us.” Apple is also promoting its investments in renewable energy at a time when many companies are retreating from climate action and the political consensus has splintered in the US, as well as in the UK and Europe. On how the company is navigating the political fractures, Ms Jackson said: “It’s important to note that we always approached the clean energy work as part of our business decisions. “So we invest in businesses, and those businesses are investing, not out of the goodness of their heart, but because they see an opportunity to do what businesses do, which is make money selling the energy that comes from these projects. “So I think what’s important to us is to approach clean energy as part of the way our company operates, our values, and we’re continuing to do that.” Apple said it is prioritising projects in regions and countries where it can maximise the impact, such as Poland, which has a higher carbon intensity grid compared with some of its neighbours. Apple said it is prioritising projects in regions and countries where it can maximise the impact (Rebecca Speare-Cole/PA) The firm facilitates the construction of projects through different mechanisms, including long-term power purchase agreements that provide developers with the certainty to secure financing with proof of a buyer, as well as some directly run projects and some equity investments. So far, Apple said its involvement in the projects announced on Tuesday has helped to unlock 600 million dollars (£450 million) in financing. The company has signed a long-term agreement to procure power from a 110MW solar project in Greece, and is also supporting the development of a 129MW portfolio of wind and solar projects in Italy as well as a 40MW solar array in Poland. Elsewhere, it plans to procure power from Nala Renewables’ 99MW wind farm in Romania’s Galati County and has signed a power purchase agreement for electricity from a 110 MW solar farm in Latvia.

      "text": "1 Unstoppable Stock Poised to Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club by 2027 By Danny Vena – Updated Oct 13, 2025 at 9:02PM Key Points The need for high-performance AI processors has surged in recent years. Taiwan Semiconductor dominates the market for next-generation AI chips and is partners with the biggest names in tech. Despite its critical position in the AI revolution, the stock remains attractively priced. NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Market Cap $1.5T Today's Change angle-down ( 1.54 %) $ 4.49 Current Price $ 295.22 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 3:58 PM ET Semiconductors form the foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, and this company is ringing the cash register. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) less than three years ago has sparked a paradigm shift in the technology space. Don't take my word for it: The world's five most valuable companies -- each with market caps of more than $2 trillion -- are leading innovators in the field of AI. AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the world's largest publicly traded company , valued at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the industry standard for AI workloads. Enterprise and cloud provider Microsoft provides a growing suite of AI tools, whikch has driven its value to $3.9 trillion. With more than 1 billion iPhones in the wild, Apple has a captive audience for its Apple Intelligence (AI) ambitions, pushing its market cap to $3.8 trillion. Cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon round out the top five, boasting values of $2.9 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively. With a market cap of roughly $1.5 trillion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM +1.54% ) , often referred to as TSMC, is on the fast track to join this elite fraternity. The adoption of AI continues at a hectic pace, fueling blistering demand for its most advanced chips. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC is on the fast track to meet the requirements for membership in this exclusive club -- and it might happen sooner than investors realize. Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Want chips with that? TMSC has worked behind the scenes for years, fabricating the most advanced processors, but recently found itself in the spotlight. Management bills the company as the \"world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,\" making it a critical provider in the supply chain for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI. And make no mistake, no foundry is as well-regarded as TSMC. Its customer list reads like the Who's-Who of tech glitterati, and includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings , Advanced Micro Devices , and Apple, among others. With the surge in demand for AI-centric processors, TSMC is no longer dependent merely on smartphone chips. In fact, the lion's share of the company's revenue now comes from the advanced processors needed for HPC and AI, recently responsible for 60% of sales. TSMC's growth continues to accelerate. In the second quarter, revenue of $30 billion grew 44% in U.S. dollars, while earnings per ADR soared 67% to $2.47. Management expects this trend to continue. TSMC is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 38%, and the company has been known to underpromise and overdeliver. Expand NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today's Change ( 1.54 %) $ 4.49 Current Price $ 295.22 Key Data Points Market Cap $1530B Day's Range $ 294.48 - $ 297.90 52wk Range $ 134.25 - $ 311.37 Volume 479K Avg Vol 12M Gross Margin 58.06 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % The path to $1 trillion TSMC is in an enviable position as the world scrambles to adopt this groundbreaking technology. The company is well positioned to benefit from advances in generative AI , counting the biggest names in technology as its customers. Furthermore, TSMC's rapid revenue growth is the clearest sign yet that it is poised to profit from this opportunity. As such, TSMC should soon be joining the company of multi-trillionaires. According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of $123.3 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 12.8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSMC would have to generate revenue of roughly $156 billion annually to justify a $2 trillion market cap. It's telling that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 18% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. If the company achieves those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in 2027. That said, given the company's accelerating growth in recent years, it will likely make the grade even sooner. Estimates regarding the market potential of AI continue to rachet higher. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the coming decade. That could be conservative, as new use cases for AI are continually being developed. Finally, at roughly 30 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors a practical way to invest in a once-in-a-generation opportunity.
