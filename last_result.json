These innovations are designed to make payments faster and more efficient, which is exciting for the company's future growth and has led to its stock performing well. However, there's also a bit of worry as the U.S. Department of Justice asked for a pause in an ongoing legal case about how V handles debit card payments. Despite this potential issue, V's focus on future payment technologies seems to be keeping investors largely optimistic about its business.",

AFRM has teamed up with Ace Hardware, making it easier for customers to enjoy more flexible payment options at checkout with convenient buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions in stores. This partnership marks a significant step in AFRM’s plan to integrate itself into everyday retail experiences while enhancing Ace Hardware’s appeal for shoppers who seek affordability without compromising quality. Through this collaboration, customers at participating Ace locations can now split their purchases into more manageable payments, often with clear terms and no hidden fees. For those dealing with tighter budgets, this added flexibility can make it easier to buy large items for their backyard projects, lawn and home improvements. Customers need to just scan a QR code at checkout, complete a quick eligibility check, and they can access customized payment options for purchases starting at just $50. The BNPL space has evolved from its e-commerce roots, making a stronghold in everyday retail. As consumers increasingly seek transparency and flexibility in managing their purchases, brick-and-mortar stores are jumping on BNPL solutions. This change is not just transforming the checkout process but also solidifying BNPL as a go-to financial option for many consumers. AFRM continues to strengthen its foothold across both online and offline retail. By expanding into home improvement retail, the company could attract a wide range of customers and boost transaction volumes, which might help it achieve long-term growth. Its total transactions surged 51.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. How Are Competitors Faring? Some of AFRM’s competitors in the BNPL space are Mastercard Incorporated MA and Visa Inc. V. Mastercard is stepping up its game in the BNPL space with the introduction of Mastercard Installments. This new program allows banks, lenders and fintech companies to provide BNPL options through Mastercard’s extensive network. Mastercard reported 16.8% year-over-year growth in net revenues in the second quarter of 2025. Visa’s processed transactions increased 10% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Visa’s payment volume rose 8% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, along with 14% growth in net revenues. Affirm’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates In the year-to-date period, AFRM’s shares gained 27.1% compared with the industry’s rise of 19.5%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, AFRM trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 6, slightly above the industry average of 5.62. AFRM carries a Value Score of F. Story Continues Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Affirm’s fiscal 2026 earnings implies 473.3% growth from the year-ago period.

The company generates incredible profits thanks to its very lucrative platform. It's probably best to wait for a pullback before buying the stock. NYSE : MA Mastercard Market Cap $519B Today's Change angle-down ( -0.02 %) $ 0.10 Current Price $ 573.67 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET This leading card payments processor has seen its stock price soar in the past couple of decades. Along with Visa , Mastercard ( MA 0.02% ) dominates the market for processing debit and credit card transactions. It's a payments giant that has generated some serious wealth. Shares have climbed an impressive 12,260% since the company's initial public offering in 2006 (as of Sept. 30). Mastercard shares might be trading 5% off their peak, but they have been hitting new all-time highs in 2025. Wall Street is clearly bullish on this fintech stock. Here's one obvious reason that's probably the case. Show me the money One clear sign of a wonderful company is huge profits. Mastercard doesn't disappoint in this regard. This is one of the most lucrative businesses on the planet. In the past decade, Mastercard has registered an average net profit margin of 42.1%. Thanks to steady revenue growth, net income has climbed at a wonderful pace. Between Q2 2015 through the second quarter of this year, diluted earnings per share have increased at a compound annual rate of 17.5%. This is a truly exceptional track record of bottom-line performance. Expand NYSE : MA Mastercard Today's Change ( -0.02 %) $ -0.10 Current Price $ 573.67 Key Data Points Market Cap $519B Day's Range $ 573.08 - $ 580.82 52wk Range $ 465.59 - $ 601.77 Volume 1.8M Avg Vol 2.6M Gross Margin 96.65 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % Lucrative business model The credit goes to the company's business model , which requires low capital expenditures and scales up well. Mastercard makes money anytime transactions run across its payment network. Besides not lending its own capital, the best part is that the technological infrastructure is already built out. Don't rush to buy the stock just yet. At a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.1, the valuation is steep.

      "text": "An article from Dive Brief Checkout.com seeks Georgia banking charter If Checkout.com succeeds in its bid to be a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank, it would become the third company – after Fiserv and Stripe – to do so. Published Oct. 3, 2025 Gabrielle Saulsbery Reporter post share post print email license Checkout.com is seeking a special purpose banking license in Georgia. Permission granted by Checkout.com Dive Brief: Digital payments processor Checkout.com has submitted its application for a banking charter to the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance, the company said Friday . The U.K.-based firm is seeking Georgia’s merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter to facilitate its U.S. expansion and gain direct access to the payment networks of behemoths Visa and Mastercard. If the bid is successful, Checkout.com would be the third payments firm – after Fiserv and Stripe – with a Georgia special purpose banking charter. The charter allows payments processors to bypass banks to underwrite merchants, authorize and settle transactions, and provide network access to its affiliates. Dive Insight: Among its main features: The charter allows processors to avoid banks’ fees and better compete on price . From a risk management standpoint, access to the Visa and Mastercard networks eliminates an integration point, explained Jordan Reynolds, Checkout.com’s North America banking head. A charter would also drive innovation for Checkout.com, he said. “In today’s world, if we’re launching new products and services that touch any of the authorization or money movement flow, we have to work with our bank partners on the other side to drive integrations,” Reynolds said. “It certainly limits our ability to move at pace, and this charter allows us to move much faster and innovate much faster for our merchants.” Checkout.com uses Cross River Bank and Pathward Financial as its partner banks and would keep them on after its own potential chartering, Reynolds said. Chartering is “a multi-year journey” and Checkout.com will still need the partnerships in the future, he said. The department has three months to act on Checkout.com’s charter application, Bo Fears, a spokesperson for the Georgia banking authority, said Thursday via email. Reynolds said he hopes to have Checkout.com’s chartered services fully operational in 2026. Georgia’s MALPB charter is “one of a kind in the U.S.” as far as chartering goes, Reynolds said. Milwaukee-based Fiserv was granted its charter in September 2024 and Stripe received the charter three months ago. “It’s an extension of Georgia being a fintech hub for the merchant acquiring space,” Reynolds said, whose company focuses on large digital merchants like eBay and Pinterest. Checkout.com has about 2,000 employees globally, and processes about $1 billion in daily e-commerce payment volume. Roughly 70% of the payments processed annually worldwide are processed in Atlanta, according to the American Transaction Processors Coalition . It’s not a new trend – the ATPC claims more than 85 billion of 135 billion global payments were processed in Georgia in 2012. The U.S. will be Checkout.com’s “largest market over the next couple of years” with the banking charter demonstrating the company’s U.S. commitment, Reynolds said.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PayPal Holdings PYPL, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group IBKR and Visa Inc. V. Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog: 4 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Makes Steady Recovery The cryptocurrency market is steadily recovering after giving up its earlier gains last month. Bitcoin (BTC), which hit an all-time high in July before giving up nearly 15% of its gains last month, rebounded to a seven-week high on Wednesday night. Markets have been volatile over the past month due to concerns over a shrinking labor market and a slowing economy. This has also been impacting the crypto market. However, the volatility is temporary and Bitcoin is expected to resume its rally once investors get a clearer picture of the economy’s health. Given this situation, it would be ideal to take the buy-the-dip approach and invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected four stocks: PayPal Holdings , Robinhood Markets, Inc. , Interactive Brokers Group and Visa Inc. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Bitcoin Making a Rebound Bitcoin rebounded on Wednesday night and was trading at a seven-week high of $118,481, to hit a seven-week high. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124.496 before giving up most of its gains in September on growing uncertainty over the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and concerns of a weakening economy. Wednesday’s jump came after the U.S. government partially shut down. According to reports cited by investing.com, the threat of a government shutdown could end up pushing extra liquidity into the markets. Experts believe that Bitcoin still has ample room to grow as demand remains robust. According to an on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant report, cited by The Block, Bitcoin could hit $160,000 to $200,000, this year if demand continues to remain high. Also, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last month and hinted at two more quarter percentage point rate cuts this year. This is expected to boost Bitcoin further. 4 Crypto-Centric Stocks with Upside PayPal Holdings PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Through PYPL, cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services from online merchants.

      "text": "Visa Visa to open Visa Direct to stablecoins By Joey Pizzolato CloseText About Joey twitter joeypizzolato mailto joey.pizzolato@arizent.com linkedin joey-pizzolato-02178325 October 02, 2025, 3:40 p.m. EDT 4 Min Read Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Key insights : Visa is launching a stablecoin prefunding pilot for accounts-based transfers through Visa Direct. What's at stake : Payment companies have been rushing to identify the first scalable use cases for stablecoins following the passage of the GENIUS Act. Forward look : The pilot is expected to be available on a limited basis in April 2026. Payment companies have been rushing to find the first use cases for stablecoins following the passage of the GENIUS Act, and cross-border payments has become a favorite among first movers. Visa is opening its cross-border real-time payments network, Visa Direct, to a stablecoin prefunding pilot that will allow companies to move money to accounts in different countries instantaneously, even when banks are closed. \"What we're doing here is showing the world how stablecoins and the technology can help modernize our existing infrastructure and our existing payment methods,\" Mark Nelsen, head of product at Visa Commercial and Money Movement Solutions, told American Banker. \"We didn't do anything different with our payment network, it's still acting as it normally would.\" At its core, Visa is positioning Visa Direct as the Switzerland for processing third-party tokens using its existing rules, policies and network procedures, Richard Crone, CEO of Crone Consulting, told American Banker. \"Visa is not issuing its own stablecoin, nor any co-branded stablecoin,\" Crone said. \"The release confirms support for third-party tokens only … but casts the model widely to include any approved issuer, including PayPal's PYUSD and others that can pre-fund Visa Direct.\" Visa Direct processed 10 billion transactions in 2024 and reaches 11 billion endpoints, including 3.5 billion bank accounts, 4 billion cards and 3.5 billion wallets, according to Visa. How the prefunding pilot works Visa's stablecoin prefunding pilot allows companies to send money to accounts in different countries using stablecoins, rather than having to park cash in a bank account overseas. For example, if a rideshare company needs to pay drivers in another country over the weekend, it previously would have had to put three days' worth of collateral in a bank to handle those daily payouts in local currency. That poses a problem for companies, Nelsen said. \"If, for whatever reason, it's a busy weekend and you start running out of money … and it's a Saturday afternoon and you need to top up this account, there's no easy way to do that, because the banks are closed. If you want to move money to a bank account, you need to wait until Monday.\" Visa's stablecoin pilot is intended to smooth out that process by making funds available immediately, Nelsen said. \"If the client wanted to top off their account, they could simply send us stablecoins and we would immediately recognize that stablecoin and update their account balance and say, 'OK, you now have the funds available to continue to pay out your drivers.\" Companies are able to convert funds into stablecoins over the weekend because stablecoin exchanges are open around the clock, Nelsen said, noting that the funds are paid out in local fiat. Visa intends to support any stablecoin that is valid and \"has meaningful volume,\" Nelsen said. Use cases abound The first focus for the pilot will be on large remitters, but Visa sees a number of other use cases where stablecoins can be deployed. \"We can use stablecoins for settlement. Or stablecoins can also be used by consumers whereby, let's say you have a stablecoin wallet, you can have a Visa debit card attached to it and you can use that debit card at any merchant in the world that accepts a Visa card,\" Nelsen said. \"You're starting to see all these little use cases that stablecoins could be applied just to make kind of what we do today a little bit better.\" Business-to-business accounts payable is another strong use case for stablecoin payouts, Crone said. \"Visa Direct is well-suited for reach and speed, but not for approval workflows or invoice reconciliation — the real greenfield for chargeable services.\" Such use cases typically require integration of enterprise resource planning, electronic invoice presentment and payment, accounts payable and accounts receivable systems. B2B accounts payable is the single largest opportunity in payments, according to Crone Consulting, with a global total addressable market of $120 trillion to $140 trillion, including $32 trillion to $40 trillion worth of cross-border transactions. Still, regulatory clarity remains a challenge to simply rolling out stablecoin payouts to each of Visa Direct's 11 billion endpoints, Visa's Nelsen said. \"There's a handful of countries now that have something similar [to the GENIUS Act]. Over the next couple years, as you get more commonality globally around what the licensing requirements are going to be, you'll see it take off a little bit more,\" Nelsen said.

Bitcoin (BTC), which hit an all-time high in July before giving up nearly 15% of its gains last month, rebounded to a seven-week high on Wednesday night. Markets have been volatile over the past month due to concerns over a shrinking labor market and a slowing economy. This has also been impacting the crypto market. However, the volatility is temporary and Bitcoin is expected to resume its rally once investors get a clearer picture of the economy’s health. Given this situation, it would be ideal to take the buy-the-dip approach and invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected four stocks: PayPal Holdings PYPL, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group IBKR and Visa Inc. V. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Bitcoin Making a Rebound Bitcoin rebounded on Wednesday night and was trading at a seven-week high of $118,481, to hit a seven-week high. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124.496 before giving up most of its gains in September on growing uncertainty over the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and concerns of a weakening economy. Wednesday’s jump came after the U.S. government partially shut down. According to reports cited by investing.com, the threat of a government shutdown could end up pushing extra liquidity into the markets. Experts believe that Bitcoin still has ample room to grow as demand remains robust. According to an on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant report, cited by The Block, Bitcoin could hit $160,000 to $200,000, this year if demand continues to remain high. Also, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last month and hinted at two more quarter percentage point rate cuts this year. This is expected to boost Bitcoin further. 4 Crypto-Centric Stocks With Upside PayPal Holdings PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

Shares of data streaming platform provider Confluent (NASDAQ:CFLT) jumped 3.5% in the afternoon session after Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the company with an 'Overweight' rating and a $24 price target. The bank viewed Confluent as establishing \"the standard for data streaming in an AI world.\" This positive outlook was supported by the company's solid financial performance, which included a reported 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Adding to the positive news, Confluent also announced a new multi-year partnership with the Visa Cash App Racing Bulls Formula 1 team. The collaboration aimed to bring Confluent's data streaming platform to the high-stakes environment of Formula 1, providing the racing team with real-time information to inform its decisions. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $20.57, up 4.3% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Confluent? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . What Is The Market Telling Us Confluent’s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped on the news that the company announced a new multi-year partnership with the Visa Cash App Racing Bulls (VCARB) Formula 1 team. Confluent is down 27.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $20.57 per share, it is trading 45.4% below its 52-week high of $37.65 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Confluent’s shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $457.00. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

      "text": "JKHY Powers Mercantile Bank's Expansion With Core Innovation Zacks Equity Research October 2, 2025 3 min read In this article: MA V JKHY MBWM Jack Henry & Associates JKHY has signed a new core client, Mercantile Bank, which is the largest community bank in Michigan with $6.2 billion in assets. Mercantile Bank aims to use Jack Henry & Associates’ core processing platform and Enterprise Workflow tools to focus on improving efficiency, while reducing manual work, and support its expansion plans. Mercantile Bank, which was founded in 1997, has grown through both new branches and acquisitions. It now has nearly 50 locations across Michigan and is expanding in Detroit, Eastern Michigan, and the Lakeshore. To support this growth, the bank ran a two-year review with more than 60 stakeholders before choosing Jack Henry & Associates. The choice shows how Jack Henry & Associates’ open and flexible technology is appealing to community banks that want to modernize systems and cut costs. Mercantile Bank’s leaders also said Jack Henry & Associates’ culture and service approach were a good fit. For Jack Henry & Associates, this win adds to its record of signing larger banks and expanding its base among community and regional institutions. It also shows the company’s ability to compete with larger core providers as banks seek new technology to stay competitive. This deal also supports Jack Henry & Associates’ long-term growth strategy, which focuses on adding recurring revenues from core clients while helping banks move toward more digital and automated systems. Jack Henry Connects Small Banks to Everyday Payment Tools Jack Henry’s growth in digital payments is not happening alone. The company is working with Visa V and Mastercard MA to power its new Rapid Transfers product, which allows consumers and small businesses to quickly transfer money between accounts, cards, and wallets. Both Visa and Mastercard have already certified Jack Henry’s solution, which is being rolled out to clients on the Banno digital platform. This partnership with Visa and Mastercard shows how Jack Henry is using established payment rails to compete more effectively in the fast-moving real-time payments space. Jack Henry’s role in community banking goes beyond back-end systems. Its technology platform gives smaller banks access to modern retail payment tools, such as Zelle, Apple ’s AAPL Apple Pay, and instant debit issuance. The SouthTrust Bank deal shows how this works in practice. In May 2025, SouthTrust, which is a $550 million-asset bank in Texas, selected Jack Henry to upgrade its core systems and digital offerings. Utilizing Jack Henry’s platform, the bank is now able to integrate with third-party fintechs and roll out the features that were once too expensive or complex. This includes Apple Pay, enabling customers to make secure, contactless payments directly from their iPhones, as well as Zelle, which can be used for person-to-person transfers. By enabling Apple Pay and other services, Jack Henry aims to help community banks stay competitive with larger banks and fintechs. Moreover, this also shows how JKHY continues to actively work with major players, such as Apple, Visa, and Mastercard, in order to bring modern payments into the community banking market, all of which are central to digital payments.

      "text": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in October By Brett Schafer – Oct 2, 2025 at 5:45AM Key Points American Express is a premium charge card provider with strong pricing power. Visa has a high-margin business model that is protected from inflation. NYSE : AXP American Express Market Cap $246B Today's Change angle-down ( 0.74 %) $ 2.63 Current Price $ 357.56 Price as of October 24, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET American Express and Visa have dominated the payments industry for decades. Warren Buffett may be retiring from his role as chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) at the end of this year, but it can still pay to follow what the Oracle of Omaha is doing with the conglomerate's stock portfolio. The legendary investor has a phenomenal track record, and his stock picks are easily replicable in your own portfolio. Moreover, the core of his strategy is fairly simple: Buy stocks and hold them for the long haul. Another central premise he follows is to invest in what he understands, and one of his specialties is the financial sector. Here are two Buffett stocks in that industry to buy hand over fist in the month of October. Expand NYSE : AXP American Express Today's Change ( 0.74 %) $ 2.63 Current Price $ 357.56 Key Data Points Market Cap $246B Day's Range $ 356.87 - $ 362.32 52wk Range $ 220.43 - $ 362.32 Volume 2.4M Avg Vol 2.6M Gross Margin 61.04 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % A card giant with pricing power The second-largest position in the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio is American Express ( AXP +0.74% ) . The conglomerate owns more than 20% of this dominant player in the premium credit card sector. For decades, American Express has catered to wealthier clients with a variety of credit and charge cards for consumers and businesses. It focuses on providing value for travel, entertainment, and restaurant spending across the U.S., and has a presence in a few other wealthy countries as well. Last quarter, American Express added 3.1 million new cards. About half went to consumers in the U.S., while the rest were for international and business cards. The company has close to 150 million total cards in circulation. Even though American Express cards have some of the highest fees in the industry, the company has been able to achieve consistent pricing power because of the large array of benefits it has built for its members, such as access to airport lounges. Last year, it increased the fee for its Gold card from $250 a year to $325. And in September, it bumped the Platinum card's annual fee from $695 to $895, which will help the company keep increasing its fee revenue. Given the new members joining American Express every quarter and the pricing power flexed by the company, it is no surprise that American Express's earnings per share ( EPS ) has grown by roughly 158% during the past 10 years.   During the next 10 years, I expect similar levels of earnings growth. Image source: Getty Images. Durable growth in digital payments Another payments provider in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is Visa ( V +0.41% ) . Visa operates the largest credit card network in the world. Unlike American Express, it does not issue cards, charge annual fees, or manage customer credit risk. Instead, Visa simply processes the payments when someone uses a card connected to its network, in exchange for a small transaction fee. Partner institutions such as Bank of America or JPMorgan Chase do all the account management. What this means is that Visa only keeps a small portion of the credit card swipe fees, but offloads all the costs and lending risks to third parties. The result is that it operates with an incredible EBIT ( earnings before interest and taxes ) margin of 67%. Revenue will keep growing in tandem with payment volume, which is protected from inflation because the fees it charges are calculated as a percentage of the transaction size. During the past 10 years, Visa's revenue has grown by 180%, an impressive feat for a company that is already one of the world's largest by market capitalization. Thanks to operating leverage and share repurchases, its EPS grew by an even more impressive 298%. Visa and American Express have been mainstays in payments for decades. They should remain so for decades to come. This durability has given Buffett the confidence to buy both stocks for Berkshire Hathaway, a company that retail investors can easily take their cues from, as long as they're willing to implement a buy-and-hold strategy with a time horizon measured in decades, not years.

      "text": "An article from Dive Brief DOJ granted brief stay in Visa debit case The U.S. government’s closure this week prompted the Justice Department to request a “temporary” pause in its antitrust lawsuit against Visa. Published Oct. 2, 2025 • Updated Oct. 3, 2025 Justin Bachman Senior Reporter post share post print email license The U.S. courthouse in New York City. Getty Images UPDATE: Oct. 3, 2025: A federal judge granted the Justice Department’s request for a temporary stay in its lawsuit against Visa due to the U.S. government closure. Dive Brief: T he Justice Department has gotten a temporary stay in its 2024 antitrust lawsuit against Visa due to the lack of agency funding from Congress. The government also asked the court this week to extend deadlines for the parties the same number of days as the government shutdown lasts. Without funding, DOJ attorneys and employees “are generally prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances such as ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” DOJ attorney Craig Conrath wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge John Koeltl. Visa did not oppose the stay request, the DOJ said. Koeltl granted the stay request on Thursday. Federal courts will operate as usual until Oct. 17 using “court fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation,” the U.S. Courts said Wednesday in a press release . Dive Insight: While Visa didn’t oppose Koeltl pausing the proceedings temporarily, the card network requested “that any stay imposed by the court not cover negotiations and obligations related to third-party document subpoenas issued by Visa,” Conrath wrote. “We greatly regret any disruption caused by these circumstances,” the DOJ letter said. The DOJ, under the Biden administration, alleged that Visa operated an illegal monopoly in the debit card market. The lawsuit has carried on under the Trump administration. San Francisco-based Visa handles more than 60% of U.S. debit card transactions on its network, collecting more than $7 billion annually in processing fees, according to the complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Mastercard is a distant second in the market, with less than a quarter of the debit-processing market, the lawsuit said. In June, Koeltl denied Visa’s motion to dismiss the complaint, which alleged that Visa imposes agreements on merchants and banks that exclude potential competitors from debit processing. Visa has denied the claims and said it doesn’t have a monopoly on debit card transactions. Prior to the government funding lapse, Visa and the DOJ told the court they are making progress in their negotiations about the amount of electronic debit card data Visa will produce for discovery. The parties “are substantially closer to finalizing the scope of data to be provided,” they said in a Sept. 26 status report. The government has narrowed some of its data requests to address Visa’s objections about the relevance of some material and difficulties of extracting large data sets from Visa’s system, the DOJ said. The government has given Visa its “finalized data field requests” for four of six data categories, the DOJ said. Americans purchase more than $4 trillion worth of goods and services with debit cards each year, according to the September 2024 complaint. Visa’s monopoly in the debit card payments market adds billions of dollars in extra fees U.S. consumers pay when merchants increase prices to cover added costs for debit card purchases, the DOJ said when it filed the lawsuit.

The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.34%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.42%. The global payments processor's shares have seen a decrease of 2.48% over the last month, not keeping up with the Business Services sector's gain of 0.7% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.54%. The upcoming earnings release of Visa will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Visa to post earnings of $2.96 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.23%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.59 billion, up 10.14% from the year-ago period. V's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.43 per share and revenue of $39.84 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.73% and 0%, respectively. Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Visa. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system. The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher within the past month. Visa is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. With respect to valuation, Visa is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 29.86. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.31, so one might conclude that Visa is trading at a premium comparatively. It's also important to note that V currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.27. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The Financial Transaction Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.16 as trading concluded yesterday. The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 38, placing it within the top 16% of over 250 industries.

      "text": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Visa (V): Read This Before Placing a Bet Zacks Equity Research October 1, 2025 4 min read In this article: V Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Visa (V). Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.54, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.54 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 25 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 67.6% and 10.8% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for V Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for V Check price target & stock forecast for Visa here>>> While the ABR calls for buying Visa, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether. Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. Story Continues It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research. In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. Is V Worth Investing In? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $11.43. Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa.

Milliseconds of Advantage: Confluent and Visa Cash App Racing Bulls Partner for Real-Time Intelligence Business Wire October 1, 2025 4 min read In this article: CFLT V New multi-year partnership powers Visa Cash App Racing Bulls Formula 1 team with real-time data for faster race-day calls and smarter engineering MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., October 01, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Confluent, Inc. (Nasdaq: CFLT), the data streaming pioneer, today announced a new multi-year partnership with the Visa Cash App Racing Bulls (VCARB) Formula 1 team. From this weekend at the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix, the VCARB 02 will hit the track with Confluent’s logo on its halo and upper sidepods. This marks a partnership that will bring Confluent’s industry leading data streaming platform to the high-stakes world of Formula 1, giving VCARB the real-time intelligence needed to make faster, smarter decisions on and off the track. Formula 1 is one of the most advanced proving grounds for technology in the world. Every decision, from the split-second calls on race day to the design and development of next-generation cars, depends on data. Each car generates more than a million data points every second, from tire performance, and aerodynamic forces to car handling characteristics and driver performance. With Confluent, VCARB can set this data in motion across its entire operation, creating a central nervous system that connects car, pit wall, and factory. These insights not only decide the outcome of a race but also accelerate engineering cycles and streamline logistics. \"In Formula 1, winning isn’t just about the car; it’s about the data flowing through every part of the team,\" said Jay Kreps, CEO and co-founder of Confluent. \"This partnership with VCARB shows what’s possible when real-time data streaming becomes as central to racing as the engine itself. Every lap generates insights that fuel human decision-making today and train the AI and machine learning models that will shape tomorrow’s cars and race strategies. We’re thrilled to be innovating at that speed together.\" For VCARB, data is as important as fuel. The team relies on streams of telemetry and simulation data to guide every element of race-day strategy and year-round performance development. \"Every lap teaches us something new, and the faster we can learn, the better we get,\" said Tim Goss, Chief Technical Officer of VCARB. \"With Confluent, data becomes a competitive edge that not only helps us make smarter decisions during a race but also guides post-race analysis and even car design. Together, these insights help us close the gap to the front of the grid.\" This partnership positions Formula 1, where the relentless pressure of competition tests real-time data infrastructure at its highest limits, as a living lab for Confluent’s technology. It’s also about creating a continuous loop of learning and improvement in which every data point from the track informs smarter engineering decisions, more efficient logistics, and new ways of engaging fans. United by a challenger ethos of defying convention, innovating with speed, and rewriting what’s possible, Confluent and VCARB aim to show that real-time data is vital not just in racing but in every business striving for a competitive edge. Story Continues About Confluent Confluent is the data streaming platform that is pioneering a fundamentally new category of data infrastructure that sets data in motion. Confluent’s cloud-native offering is the foundational platform for data in motion—designed to be the intelligent connective tissue enabling real-time data from multiple sources to constantly stream across an organization.

In the pilot, Visa Direct will test stablecoins as an alternative funding source to simplify transactions, reduce frictions and provide financial institutions with greater flexibility in managing global payouts. According to the company, the pilot will allow businesses to pre-fund Visa Direct with stablecoins instead of fiat currency, treating stablecoins as equivalent to money in the bank. This approach is said to improve liquidity by freeing up capital, enabling quicker transactions, and offering a stable settlement layer that mitigates local currency volatility.
